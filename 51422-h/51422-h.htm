  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>In one of the closing days of August, 1905, the
author of this work, <span class='sc'>Frances D. Jermain</span>, received
the summons of her Maker to join the Silent Majority.
The call came suddenly, finding her in the
full possession of her ever remarkable intellectual
powers, and with the ambition for much yet to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>For nearly twenty-five years, she had been at the
head of the Toledo Public Library, in the upbuilding
of which she was ever the inspiration and the guiding
spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>With more than the ordinary capacity for organization
and the practical, she planned and carried out
the working details of all notable improvements, in
that thoroughly modern library.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others, who took up the work from which she retired
about a year before her death, will carry it forward
with that devotion and capacity which it should
inspire; but they will but build additions to the edifice
which she reared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her death brought forth a remarkable outpouring
of voluntary tributes to her worth and work. From
these has come the realization that by her death
Toledo has lost one whose influence upon its intellectual
life was the most potent and far reaching of
any citizen it has ever lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Living and working nobly in public as in her
ideally perfect domestic life, her loss is profoundly
felt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'>[4]</span>Political administrations came and went, party
triumphs and party defeats lived out “their little
day” and are long since forgot; but year after
year, until a quarter of a century had nearly gone,
this brave and learned little woman ruled, with
gentle power and kindly wisdom, the destinies of
the Toledo Public Library.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the growth and development of this notable
public institution, selecting its contents, the literary
advisor of lawyers, journalists, educators and students,
she acquired, with her discriminating judgment
and retentive memory, a remarkable knowledge
of the contents of books. A subject practically
never arose upon which she could not at once give,
either the needed reference or the full information
required, and the library contained seventy thousand
volumes!</p>

<p class='c000'>In this reference work, she became deeply impressed
with the need of a concise history of the beginnings
and development of our modern alphabet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The information on the subject was widely scattered
and very great. It was found nowhere in a
condensed and yet adequate form. She knew from
experience what the value to libraries, educators
and students generally, a concise history upon the
subject would be.</p>

<p class='c000'>This she undertook and finally completed. Not
confining her account to information gathered from
works already published dealing with the subject,
she kept in constant correspondence with the leading
archæologists carrying on researches in both
Egypt and the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus she literally walked with these great scholars
“In the Path of the Alphabet,” and her work took
on that original and valuable character based upon
those most recent and wonderful discoveries which
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'>[5]</span>have forever silenced the voice of “The Higher
Criticism.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This work, which we now reverently give to public
print, is therefore based upon her broad and
deep knowledge upon the subject—from original
sources; a work of patient labor; of a profound
Christian faith; a work begun and finished in that
spirit by which alone the best work of God’s laborers
needs must be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon her behalf, grateful acknowledgment is here
made to Professor <span class='sc'>A. H. Sayce</span>, Professor <span class='sc'>H. V.
Hilprecht</span>, Professor <span class='sc'>James A. Craig</span> and Professor
<span class='sc'>C. R. Condor</span>, who walked with her “In the
Path of the Alphabet.”</p>

OF all the splendid achievements of
archæological research during the
present century, there are none of
more universal interest and importance than
those which are revealing the origin and history
of letters; this, not alone for the historic
values of these discoveries, for their illumination
of a past of which hitherto there was but
a faint conception; but also for what letters
have to tell us in explanation or confirmation
of Biblical narrative, of their bearing upon
our most sacred beliefs.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the beginning of the present century the
great mass of testimony now laid open before
us was an apparently impenetrable mystery.
Egyptian hieroglyphics and cuneiform inscriptions
yet remained, for the most part, but
confusion of ornament and meaningless signs.
Some little advance, it is true, had been reached
during the latter part of the eighteenth century,
as to the signification of certain hieroglyphic
characters, but these were as yet but
conjecture; a groping in the dark, with no
means to verify, uncertain, unassured.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'>[10]</span>With the opening of the present century two
events occurred which were to place in the
hands of scholars the keys to these mysteries.
The first in date of these discoveries, though
not in results, was the finding of the Rosetta
Stone in 1799.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was an outcome of the French scientific
expedition to Egypt under the first Napoleon.
At this date, a French artillery officer, named
Boussard, while digging among some ruins at
Fort St. Julian, near Rosetta, discovered a large
stone, of black basalt, covered with inscriptions.
This tablet, now known as “The Rosetta
Stone,” was of irregular shape, portions having
been broken from the top and sides. The inscriptions
were in three kinds of writing; the
upper text in hieroglyphic characters, the second
in a later form of Egyptian writing, called
enchorial or demotic, and the third was in
Greek. No one of these had been entirely preserved.
Of the hieroglyphic text, a considerable
portion was lacking; perhaps thirteen or
fourteen lines at the beginning. From the
demotic, the ends of about half the lines were
lost, while the Greek text was nearly perfect,
with the exception of a few words at the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>The immediate inferences were that these
three inscriptions were but different forms of
the same decree, and that in the Greek would
be found some clew for the decipherment of the
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'>[11]</span>others. It was first presented to the French
Institute at Cairo where it was destined not
long to remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surrender of Alexandria to the British,
in 1801, placed the Rosetta Stone, by the terms
of the treaty, in the hands of the British Commissioner.
This gentleman, himself a zealous
scholar and keenly alive to the importance of
the treasure, at once dispatched it to England,
where it was presented by George III to the
British Museum.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fac simile of the inscriptions was made in
1802, by the “Society of Antiquaries,” of London,
and copies were soon distributed among
the scholars of Europe. When the Greek inscription
was read, it was found to be a decree
by the priests of Memphis in honor of King
Ptolemy Epiphanes; B. C. 198;</p>

<p class='c017'>That, in acknowledgment of many and great
benefits conferred upon them by this king, they
had ordered this decree should be engraved
upon a tablet of hard stone in hieroglyphic, enchorial
and Greek characters; the first, the
writing sacred to the priests; the second, the
language or script of the people, and the third
that of the Greeks, their rulers.</p>

<p class='c017'>Also, that this decree, so engraved, should
be set up in the temples of the first, second and
third orders, near the image of the ever living
King.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'>[12]</span>It might be supposed that with this clew the
work of decipherment would be readily accomplished.
On the contrary, many of the most
distinguished scholars of Europe tried, during
the twenty following years, without success.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief obstacle in the way was the prevailing
opinion that the pictorial forms of Egyptian
hieroglyphs were mainly ideographic symbols
of things. In consequence, the absurd
conceptions read into these characters, led all
who attempted the decipherment of these far
away from the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is true that Zoega, a Danish archæologist,
and Thomas Young, an English scholar, each
independently, about 1787, had made the discovery
that the hieroglyphs in the ovals represented
royal names, and were perhaps alphabetic;
but the signification of these characters
were never fully comprehended by either of
these great scholars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The claim made by the friends of Mr. Young
as the first discoverer of the true methods of
decipherment, rests upon the fact that he gave
the true phonetic values to five of these characters
in the spelling of the names of certain royal
personages, and in 1819 published an article
announcing this discovery. He seems, however,
to have had so little confidence in this conception
that he went no farther with it, and still
later, in 1823, lost the prestige he might have
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'>[13]</span>gained, by the publication as his belief, that
the Egyptians never made use of signs to express
sound until the time of the Roman and
Greek invasions of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The real work of decipherment was reserved
for Champollion, who, born at Grenoble, in
1790, was but nine years old when the famous
stone was discovered which later on was to
yield to him the long lost language of the hieroglyphs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the characters on the Rosetta Stone,
in the hieroglyphic text, were to be found certain
pictorial forms enclosed in an oval. It
had hitherto been suggested that these ovals
contained characters signifying royal names.
Were these symbolic signs, or how were they
to be interpreted? Champollion concluded that
some of these signs expressed sound and were
alphabetic in character. Thus, if the signs in
the cartouche supposed to signify Ptolemy,
could be found to be identical, letter for letter,
with the <i>Ptolemaios</i> of the Greek inscription,
an important proof would be obtained. It so
happened that on an obelisk found at Philæ
there was a hieroglyphic inscription, which,
according to a Greek text on the same shaft
should be that of Cleopatra. If, then, the
signs for <i>P</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>l</i> in Ptolemaios corresponded
with the signs for <i>p</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>l</i> in Cleopatra, the
identity of these as alphabetic signs would be
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'>[14]</span>confirmed. The comparison fully justified his
theory, and further confirmation was supplied
by further comparisons, until he finally came
into possession of hieroglyphic signs for all the
consonants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again; certain indications convinced him
that these characters appearing in proper names
must be also initial letters or initial sounds of
Egyptian words of which these signs were the
pictorial representations. If this was so, the
sign for the letter <i>L</i>, which in the royal names
was the picture of a lion, must be the beginning
of some word signifying “lion,” which
in old Egyptian would begin with the letter or
first syllabic sound of <i>L</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pictorial sign for the letter <i>R</i> was the
mouth. The word for mouth, then, in Egyptian
must begin with the letter or syllabic sign
for <i>R</i>, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early opportunities which Champollion
had enjoyed for the preparation of his great
work were peculiarly significant. He was educated
by his elder brother, a man of great
learning, professor of Greek in the Academy
of Grenoble, whose companionship early influenced
the direction of his younger brother to
linguistic studies. In addition to this, the intense
interest aroused throughout Europe by
the vast collection of antiquities brought thither
by the men of letters and science who accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'>[15]</span>Napoleon’s army in Egypt, had
compelled the attention of scholars to this special
field of research as never before.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this guidance, and moved by the spirit
of the times, Champollion’s studies in ancient
Greek led him to an early acquaintance with
the Coptic language. It is said that, as a result
of this study, at the age of sixteen he read
a paper before his academy, maintaining that
the Coptic was the language of the ancient
Egyptians. This is not now a spoken language,
having been supplanted by the Arabic
since the seventeenth century, A. D. It, however,
survives in the service ritual of the Coptic
churches of to-day, and, though written in
old Greek characters, the ancient language is
still heard, though but few understand it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Champollion made use of his hieroglyphic
alphabet for the spelling of other words than
proper names, his satisfaction may be imagined
when he found that these were Coptic words.
Thus, the sign for “mouth” for the letter <i>R</i>,
was the initial letter or syllabic sign of the Coptic
word <i>Ro</i>, signifying mouth. The picture
of a lion for the letter <i>L</i> also represented the
initial letter or initial syllable of <i>Lavo</i>, the Coptic
for lion. The picture of an eagle, representing
the sign for the letter <i>A</i>, is also the
sign for the initial sound or letter in <i>Ahem</i>,
the Coptic for eagle, and so on.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'>[16]</span>The language, then, of the Hieroglyphs was
Coptic, or rather in the Coptic we have a survival
of the ancient Egyptian, the language of
the pyramid builders. More correctly speaking,
it is the Egyptian language of the Ptolemaic
period, corrupted with Arabic and Greek
idioms, but still including the language of old
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, indeed, a thing which might have
been expected, that the language expressed
by the ancient Hieroglyphs should bear a
resemblance to Coptic, but that the resemblance
should be as close as it has proved could scarcely
have been expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, of special interest in this connection,
is the fact that in the Greek the writing and
language of Egypt should be thus preserved.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a>“The romance of language could go no
further,” says Mr. Butler, “than to join the
speech of Pharaoh and the writing of Homer
in the service book of an Egyptian Christian.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point, a brief reference, bridging the
centuries from the decline of the use of hieroglyphics
to the later appearance of the language
in its Coptic and Greek forms, should
have a place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extensive use of Phœnician and Greek
alphabets in Egypt and throughout the Orient,
for some centuries before the Christian era,
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'>[17]</span>had affected the Egyptian script as a social and
commercial medium. The hieroglyphics, however,
held their own with the priesthood, for
sacred and secular uses, until the time of the
Emperor Trajanus Decius, 249-252, A. D.,
which is the latest period in which we find
them employed for monumental purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little over a century later,—with the spread
of Christianity, the decline of paganism, the
destruction of the Egyptian temples and the
dispersion of the priesthood under the Emperor
Theodosius,—the interpretation of the hieroglyphics
was gradually lost, not again to be
read and understood until the discovery and
interpretation of the Rosetta Stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1822 Champollion announced the results
of his studies to the “Academy of Inscriptions”
of Paris, and followed this by the publication
of his work on the “Hieroglyphic System of
the Ancient Egyptians,” in which he discussed
the proofs that the phonetic alphabet was used
in the royal legends of all ages and is the key
to the whole hieroglyphic system.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that those who before
Champollion had undertaken the decipherment
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, had based their
efforts on the theory that these signs were
mainly ideographic. With this as a working
theory, all advance was impossible. Champollion,
on the contrary, finding the Egyptian
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'>[18]</span>system including a phonetic structure, made
this a basis for research, achieving a brilliant
success. He never fully recognized the composite
character of these phonetic signs. From
these he constructed an alphabet of nearly two
hundred signs, to which his pupil, Salvolini,
added one hundred more, thus producing an
alphabet of nearly three hundred characters.
As Lepsius was to show a little later, while
these signs are all phonetic, only a small number—thirty-four
in all—are alphabetic, the remainder
representing syllables.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible, in this brief survey, to refer
to the special advancements made by other
distinguished scholars in this field of research.
Since the death of Champollion the work of
decipherment has progressed steadily on until
the life, the literature and the language of the
old Egyptians are open pages which all may
read.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, however, many things not yet fully
understood. Of the Rosetta Stone, two of
the texts may now be said to be fully translated;
namely, the Greek and the hieroglyphic. This
has not been possible until recently, in consequence
of the mutilated condition of the tablet,
a considerable portion of the hieroglyphic text
and part of the demotic, being included in the
fragment broken off and lost. Not long ago,
however, another stele was found at En Nobeira,
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'>[19]</span>near Dammamour, containing a duplicate
copy of the Rosetta texts in perfect condition.
This is now in the museum at Boulak.</p>

<p class='c000'>The demotic text has never yet been fully
translated. This writing is a cursive script,
developed from the hieratic to express the
vulgar dialect spoken by the people. As
hieratic bears the same relation to hieroglyphic
that ordinary writing does to printing, so the
demotic, which is a further abridgment of the
hieratic, is compared to the latter as bearing
the same relation which short-hand does to
writing. Some of these latent signs have been
identified, but not all.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'>[20]</span>The first five lines of a Papyrus (containing 75 lines), being
the beginning of an ancient hymn addressed to the Deity, are
added in the original Hieratic, with the transcription in Hieroglyphic
characters. The Hieratic is read from right to left, the
Hieroglyphic from left to right. The dots in the middle or
end of the lines, written in red ink in the original manuscript,
indicate that this is a poetic composition.</p>

THE other event referred to, which was
to open to scholars another field of
research, in interest and importance
equal to the Egyptian discoveries, was the work
of Grotefend, early in the century, in the decipherment
of cuneiform inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In many parts of Persia, there are to be found
engraved upon the native rocks, or upon ruined
temples, inscriptions in peculiar characters.
These characters are called cuneiform, because
they are made up from combinations of a single
sign resembling the head of an arrow or a thin
wedge. This sign was formed in three ways,
either horizontal,
 <img class='inline c021' src='images/cunih.jpg' alt='—' />; vertical,
 <img class='inline c021' src='images/cuniv.jpg' alt='|' />; or angular,
 <img class='inline c021' src='images/cunia.jpg' alt='&lt;' />.
From these primary signs, a great variety of
combinations appear, either in groups or forming
single characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latter part of the eighteenth century,
fragments of these inscriptions, and copies of
others, had found their way to Europe and into
the hands of scholars. Although some of the
most powerful intellects of Europe had attempted
their interpretation, but little, if any progress
had been made until the beginning of the
past century.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'>[22]</span>In the year 1802, Grotefend, then a young
student in the University of Bonn, announced
to his colleagues his success in the decipherment
of a trilingual inscription copied by Niebuhr
from the ruins of a royal palace at Persepolis.
It will be remembered that this young
scholar had no Rosetta Stone, with an inscription
in a known language to indicate either
subject or language; simply the strange combinations
of these singular signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions were in three different systems
of assortment of the elemental signs, evidently
representing three different languages,
and as they were placed side by side, it was also
evident that they were three versions of the
same decree, or record of the same event. One
of the versions, which always came first, was
simpler than the others. This consisted of
about forty signs, while the others were more
complicated and numerous. Again, in this
version the groups of signs, which evidently
formed words, were separated, each from the
other, by a slanting wedge which did not appear
in the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grotefend also observed that each inscription
usually began with a certain group of words.
One of these words, on different inscriptions,
varied, while the other words of this group
remained the same. By a happy guess, he
conceived these groups to be royal names
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'>[23]</span>and titles, the words which varied on the different
inscriptions to be names of different
kings, while the words which always continued
the same in these groups were their titles.
Upon this basis he began his work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was known to scholars that certain Achæmenian
princes—Darius and his successors—had
erected some of the monuments from which
copies of the inscriptions were taken. Turning
then to the older Persian language, of the time
of Darius, for the spelling of the name of this
king, he gave alphabetic values to certain of
these signs which he supposed might spell the
name of Darius. Also, to the words which he
supposed represented the titles of this king.
These alphabetic values were based upon the
spelling of the name and titles in the ancient
Zend. In this way he obtained supposed values
of six letters in the cuneiform. He then
turned to another royal name which might be
Xerxes. The name of Darius, in old Persian,
or the Zend, is spelled: D-A-R-H-E-A-U-SCH.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the name of Xerxes, in Persian, is
KH-SCH-H-E-R-E. Now, if the third sign
in the spelling of the name of Darius was the
same as the fifth sign in the spelling of the
name Xerxes, in the Zend, this must have the
phonetic value of <i>R</i>. The comparison proved
the correctness of his conception. And again,
further confirmation appeared in another royal
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'>[24]</span>name, Artaxerxes, where the latter part of the
name was the same as the second royal name,
and the sign for the second character again corresponded
with the letter <i>R</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus he compared letter by letter, and sign
by sign, until he had found agreement in signs
and sound for the names of these kings and
their titles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grotefend never succeeded much beyond this
discovery, which was confined chiefly to the
Persian inscription. The language of the others
was unknown, and the characters peculiar
and more numerous. They each evidently represented
more ancient forms of writing, with
complications not found in the simpler Persian
version. Other scholars have however, carried
forward the work begun by Grotefend, some
of these reaching the same results independently,
as in the case of Sir Henry Rawlinson, who
applied the same processes to the other trilingual
inscriptions, quite ignorant of Grotefend’s
methods, and with further success. Still, to
Grotefend is due the honor of first discovering
the clew to the cuneiform system, and he it was
who first laid a basis for future labors, which,
wherever adopted, has reached the most satisfactory
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>As rightly conjectured, the other texts of the
trilingual inscriptions are copies of the same
decrees, addressed to other peoples of the realm,
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'>[25]</span>speaking different languages and possessing
different systems of writing. As a Persian
ruler of to-day publishes an edict in Persian,
Arabic and perhaps a Turanian dialect, so that
it may be understood by all his subjects, so the
ancient Persian kings put theirs into the languages
and systems of writing peculiar to the
principal races or people inhabiting the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not, however, until the discovery and
translation of the inscriptions at Nineveh, that
the full story of these Persian inscriptions
was distinctly revealed. It was then found that
the two other texts were addressed, the one to
a Semitic people of Persia, the other to a Turanian
people, descendants of the primitive inhabitants
of the country. The close relations
of these two systems of writing to the two similar
systems found in Assyria and Babylonia,
were in evidence of the kinship of these separate
races.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the systematic arrangement of the
vocabularies of the Semitic and Accadian people,
found in the Ninevite remains, the secret
of the Persian trilingual inscriptions came to
light, revealing the extensive use of the cuneiform
writing among the various people of western
Asia.</p>

<p class='c000'>A significant fact in the early history of the
decipherments of hieroglyphic and cuneiform
characters, are the coincidences in these narratives.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'>[26]</span>Thus the keys to both interpretations
came through the sound and spelling of the
royal names. Again, the clew given by the
Coptic to the sounds of the old Egyptian, was
also afforded by the ancient Zend, the sacred
language of the Parsees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the fact that alphabetic
signs were the key to each of these systems of
writing, we are not to find that either the hieroglyphic
or cuneiform systems were founded
on the alphabet. We are to find that alphabetism
and a pure alphabet are not identical.
We are also to find that before the simplicities
of an alphabet are reached; the art of writing
in all systems is a series of bewildering complications.</p>

WHILE yielding to the charm of
some master of language, who of
us gives a thought to the fact
that the grace and flow, the flexibility, the
mysterious eloquence of written speech is largely
due to the invention of letters. Only twenty-six
simple signs, yet what marvels of simplicity
and power! In the readiness of these
for new combinations, their varied adjustments
and readjustments in the formation of words,
we find the life and growth, and practically
unlimited expansion of language; the rhythmical
melodies of verse; those inherent powers
which render them so adaptive to the wants of
man; and withal, so easy to be acquired. Yet
writing without an alphabet is quite possible.
In fact, the history of the past is revealing
great nations and people in possession of systems
of writing and of extensive literature, not
founded on an alphabet.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are nevertheless to find that writing without
an alphabet is a difficult and complicated
matter. So serious and difficult, that comparatively
few could acquire the art, and that
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'>[28]</span>though in great measure this was confined to
special classes, as the scribes who devoted themselves
to the practice, and the priesthood who
were invested with the power, yet the art of
writing was understood and in common use to
an extent incomprehensible when the difficulties
of its acquirement are considered. The
results were nevertheless to limit the extensions
of knowledge, proving in all directions a barrier
to progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly has it been said that “The history of
our alphabet is the golden thread which entwines
itself with the long story of man’s civilization;”
that “It is the greatest triumph of
the human mind;” and again, as “The most
wonderful of intellectual achievements.” For
we are coming to know that letters are an invention,
not spontaneous productions or miracles
of language, and that evolution, as in other
directions of human inquiry, has much to say
upon their origin and history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though taking us to a past so remote, the
record for the greater part is singularly distinct
and clear. The story is, however, but a recent
revelation, not even as yet fully told, gathering
only sufficient coherence within the past forty
years to make the telling intelligible or possible.
A fragment of inscription here, a roll of
papyrus there, illuminated by the inspirations
of genius, and the ages which have so long
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'>[29]</span>withheld from us the story of our alphabet, are
slowly yielding the secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>To give in brief review the leading facts in
this story is the simple purpose of this history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before entering upon our narrative, however,
we can best understand the obstacles in this
path of research—perhaps best understand letters
themselves—by a brief survey of the principles
upon which the origin and development
of graphic representation are said to depend;
perhaps we may see more clearly how scholars
groping in the dark in their study of these unknown
characters came to perceive first one
fact and then another, until the great story of
letters was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are thus first directed to the fact that at
different periods of time, in various parts of the
globe, different races of men, each in their own
way, have invented methods of communicating
with the absent, and for the record of events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Independently of speech, or the art of writing,
other methods employed by primitive man
of communicating with his kind should first be
noted. Thus, the ancient gesture language,
common to all races and people, whereby facial
expression, attitudes or gesticulations, sorrow,
hatred, love, confidence, regret, all emotions
were expressed; that picture action which we
find appearing in picture writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, objects representing ideas which were
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'>[30]</span>used as message bearers. In illustration of this
we have the story told by Herodotus<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of the
King of the Scythians who sent as gifts to
Darius when about to invade Scythia, a bird, a
mouse, a frog and five arrows. When the Persians
asked of the messengers the meaning of
these gifts, they would not explain, but told
them they should discover for themselves what
these things signified. The interpretation suggested
by Darius was, that since a mouse is
bred in the earth, and a frog lives in the water,
the Scythians gave up land and water. The
bird signified their speedy flight, and the arrows
the surrender of their arms to the Persians.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not thus,” said Gobyas, “should you interpret
this message. It means, O Persians,
unless you become birds and fly into the air, or
mice, and hide yourselves beneath the earth,
or frogs, and leap into the lakes, ye shall never
return to your homes, but be smitten with
these arrows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Akin to objects as message bearers, is the
knight’s glove sent as a challenge to combat,
the pipe offered by the North American Indian
in token of amity, the rosemary sent in remembrance,
or the rose as a token of affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other methods employed for sending messages
are of curious interest as commonly
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'>[31]</span>used by people far removed from each other in
time and place. <a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a>As the knotted cords of the
Chinese, or the quippas of the Peruvians, which
by their numbers, the style of knotting, or the
distribution in groups, were used as message
bearers to all parts of the country. In the same
category also are the notched sticks of the
North American Indians, the tally sticks of the
Danes, the English and other people.</p>

<p class='c000'>But while in different parts of the world human
beings have invented ways of communicating
with the absent without the art of writing,
to depict an object instead of conveying
an object, would result as a simpler and more
lasting method of expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, in simple pictures of objects, we find
the earliest beginnings of the art of writing.
How these may be employed as message bearers
or for the record of events we have abundant
illustration in the picture writings of the
North American Indian on the bark of trees,
or inscribed on rocks, metal and stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same way, in rude carvings with flint
chips on bone and ivory, records of the chase
have come down to us from that far off time
when paleolythic man hunted the hairy rhinoceros,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'>[32]</span>the mammoth and the hyena in the forests
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though hardly attaining the art of writing,
pictorial representations in kind were the earliest
human attempt in this mode of expression.
Later, when pictures became the symbols of
ideas, as the picture of a bee to symbolize royalty,
of an eye to indicate seeing or knowing,
two legs to signify walking or going, or a sparrow
for cruelty or inferiority, we reach a higher
stage of progression—relics or reminiscences
often of the old gesture language, or objects
sent as symbols of ideas.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two first stages in the development of
the art of writing are known as ideograms,
where signs, symbols or figures suggest the
ideas of objects without expressing their names.
To construct a sentence in this way with the
various parts of speech, is impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next advance was phonetism, the representation
of the sound of words. Thus, the
picture of a lion or a camel will be understood
whatever the language of the picture-maker
may be. Perhaps, also, symbols for things, as
the sun for light, or an eye for seeing. “But
how,” says Hereen, “can the names of persons,
as Henry, Lewis, and the like, be distinguished
by symbolic pictures?”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is true also of many other words without
the adoption of signs or characters to represent
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'>[33]</span>sound, or the names of things, any adequate
expression of facts or ideas is impossible.
It thus came about that when pictures of objects
or symbols of ideas obtained a fixed and
permanent sign for the sound in any language
phonetism began.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the confusions which appear at this
stage are the homophones; relics of that primitive
stage in speech, the monosyllabic, when
few sounds were used to express many things.
As an example in modern English, we have
such words as pair, pare and pear; or rite,
write, right and wright; words so like in sound,
so unlike in meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our language, these homophones for the
greater part are defined by the variant spelling,
but as without an alphabet there could be no
variant spelling, other devices were necessary
to indicate the various meanings of words having
the same sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these ingenious devices, numerous, clever,
though cumbrous, yet so essential before
letters appeared, more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime, we find the same sound
sign thus came to be used for words differing
widely in sense and signification. These sound
signs were still picture writing. In no sense
were they letters or alphabetic characters, but
pictures of objects which were used to express
sound. This first stage in phonetism is therefore
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'>[34]</span>often called by philologists the rebus stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A distinct illustration of this method of sound
representation is given in the rebus form of
the sentence, “I can sail round the globe.”
Thus, the pronoun “I” is expressed by the
picture of an eye; the verb “can” by the picture
of a can; “sail” by the picture of a boat
or ship’s sail; “round” by a circle, and the
word “globe” by a student’s globe.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_034.jpg' alt='The five pictures.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In this first stage of phonetism we find that
pictures of objects do not represent these special
objects as in the purely ideographic stage,
but the sound. Again, that writing had reached
the point where signs and symbols stand for
entire words.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a monosyllabic language this might suffice.
The necessities of a polysyllabic language,
however, suggested a further advance. This
was to syllabism, the second stage in phonetism,
and here signs are used to represent the
separate articulations of which words are composed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an advanced stage of syllabism not all of
the articulations of polysyllabic words were
thus represented. Some sign attached to the
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'>[35]</span>word as a whole came to be used as the sound
value of the initial syllable of the word.</p>

<p class='c000'>This use of signs for the initial syllable of
the word is one of those tricks of abbreviation
to which the human mind inclines. It is however
scientifically known as an application of
the acrologic principle; viz: the use of a sign
primarily representing a word to denote its initial
syllable, or the initial sound. Thus we
have the use of the letters “C” for century;
“A. D.” for Anno Domini, and other familiar
examples. Also, the signs for the Phœnician
words Alph, Beth, Gimel, etc., which came
finally to appear as the initial letters of these
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time we are to remember that at
this stage these simple signs are as yet representing
syllables. They do not as yet separate
the vowels from the attached consonants, denoting
both together by a simple sign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor at this stage of writing was there any
conception of such a division. The vowel
seems to have been regarded as inhering in the
consonant. As yet no way had been devised
to express the vowel sounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>We can, however, readily perceive that any
attempt to treat pure syllabic signs alphabetically
would be impossible. The power of the
sign for Ne is not “n;” the sign for Ro is not
“r;” Se, Si and Su are not “s;” nor is Tu “t.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'>[36]</span>The selection of a number of such signs representing
initial syllables of words is termed a
syllabary. Its formation occurred when all,
or a greater part, of the unions of single consonants
with vowel sounds in a language had
received each its phonetic and characteristic
sign and was thus used independently of any
previous signification of the word from which
it was derived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Selections of these signs could be used almost
as the alphabet is used to form words. That
they were not entirely depended upon by many
intelligent nations that possessed a syllabary
is one of the curiosities in the history of written
speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The influence of the syllabaries which developed
under different conditions in various languages
is an exceedingly interesting study,
sometimes so increasing the simplicities of written
speech as to nearly approach the powers of
the alphabet; again, increasing the extraordinary
complexities writing had assumed at the
syllabic stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus these syllabaries have been at once the
despair and the illumination of scholars, who,
attempting to decipher these unknown characters
as letters, could make nothing of them, but
when finally recognizing their syllabic values,
a wonderful period in the history of letters was
revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'>[37]</span>Syllabic systems, wherever found, are a study
of special significance; so nearly alphabetic, yet
so remote; always suggesting the greater simplicities
to be, and yet so oblivious of these
simplicities.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one step further and alphabetism is at
hand. Instead of the use of the sign for the
phonetic power of the syllable, the use of this
sign for the phonetic power of the letter was
all that was necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>To many nations such an advance was inconceivable.
For this, the conception of the elementary
sounds of which words are composed
is necessary; the vowels and the consonants,
the consonant being the chief power in this
development.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested that this advance when
reached was the result of the prominence of the
consonant in the syllable. For instance, the
phonetic power of the consonant in the syllables
sa, se, si, so, su, is constant while the vowels
are variable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The consonants thus appeared to be the substantial
elements of words while the vowels
were complementary and inconstant. In this
way the sign for the syllable came finally to be
the sign for the consonant, with the vowel understood.
In confirmation of this we find that
the first appearance of alphabetic writing—that
is where letters only are used for the formation
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'>[38]</span>of words—was consonant writing. The earliest,
nearest approach to a pure alphabet, was
an alphabet of consonants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Semitic languages differ from all other
idioms in structure. The original roots of Semitic
words are tri-consonantal, consisting of
three consonants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of a language so constructed it is easy to
understand the development of such an alphabet.
The confusions of its use are also manifest.
Thus, in the changes of signification of
the Semitic root word, <i>k-t-b</i>, signifying “write”
we have, when spoken, <i>ka-ta-ba</i>, “he has written,”
<i>ku-ta-ba</i>, “it has been written,” <i>ka-ta-bu</i>,
“writing,” and <i>ka-tu-bu</i>, “written.” In
script, however, whatever the signification, in
ancient form we have simply <i>k-t-b</i> with the
many meanings supposed to be explained by
the context. In early Semitic script there was
no notation for vowel sounds, nor did these
appear until a comparatively recent date.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this source, as well as from the similarities
which these consonantal signs assumed,
have arisen many embarrassments in the translation
of Hebrew, and curious evidences in
textual criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the Semitic letters, however, we have
reached the first alphabet; not the first appearance
of letters, or alphabetic characters, but
that stage in the evolution of letters where
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'>[39]</span>these were used independently to express words.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point, surveying the course from its
beginnings, we find the tendencies of progression
are, first, simple pictures of objects; again,
these simple pictures representing ideas, then as
denoting sound or the names of objects, later
on as syllabic signs, and finally as letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along this line of progress there are, however,
certain curious phenomena which record
the historical course of writing as distinctly as
do the successive deposits of geological periods.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the tendency of all systems of writing
is from ideographism to alphabetism, not all
reached this latter stage; some gradually reached
phonetism, where they stopped. Others
advanced to syllabism and there remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another singular circumstance is that this
progress in phonetism is always without giving
up ideographism; that every stage is still picture
writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, we find each stage of progress including
previous steps of advance, until at last, as
in the Egyptian hieroglyphics, we have the
full series of pictures of objects and pictures
for sound with a formidable array of determinatives
and other special signs and significations.
This order of progress has been found so
constantly true with all original systems of
writing among all races, near and remote, that
it may be regarded as a natural, universal law.</p>

MANY eminent philologists suggest a
time in the history of human speech
when language was monosyllabic,
when by a few simple utterances human beings
were able to express many things, indicating
by gesture or tone which of the words having
the same sound was the thing expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later on we find language developed by the
connection of two or three of these root words,
agglutinated, or stuck together as one word,
by which this obtained a broader meaning.
This is the first stage in polysyllabism, and is
known as the agglutinative stage. Later, human
speech passed into the inflectional stage,
where these agglutinated words having coalesced
or melted into one, became so changed
in time by phonetic corruption that finally it
becomes impossible to determine which part
was the original root and which the modifying
element of the earlier stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the monosyllabic stage in language, the
Chinese is a distinguished example. This language
is referred to by many eminent philologists
as the most primitive in structure of any
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'>[42]</span>living tongue. It is a language of monosyllabic
roots, limited in number, these roots possessing
neither inflections nor parts of speech.
Each word is a root and each root is a word,
which in turn may be used, according to its
place in a sentence, as a verb, a noun, an adjective,
a participle, or some other grammatical
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>In speaking, the Chinese express these homophones
by varying tones and gestures. In
writing, their meaning is ingeniously explained
by the use of two characters. One of these is
a phonogram, which gives the sound of the
word; the other is an ideogram or picture form,
that explains which of the words having this
sound is the one indicated. These ideograms
are styled “keys,” and later on it will be observed
are identical with the determinatives of
the Assyrian and Egyptian systems. As an
instance of the Chinese use of these keys, is
the phonogram, <i>ha</i>. This has eight distinct
significations. Thus, it may denote a banana
tree, a war chariot, a scar, a cry, or any other
of its various significations according to the
key associated with this phonogram.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus this language, possessing but a limited
number of root words, is so expanded by the
varying combinations of phonetic signs and
ideographic characters, that its acquisition for
reading or writing is a formidable achievement.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'>[43]</span>Some of the recent dictionaries of the English
language record a vocabulary of two hundred
thousand words. To write any or all of these
one needs only to learn the twenty-six signs
of our alphabet. To write a common business
letter, or to read an ordinary book in Chinese,
it is necessary that the scribe or student should
know familiarly from six to seven thousand of
these groups of characters by which to express
the forty or fifty thousand words in the vocabulary
of the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, many of these characters are so similar
in form that to write them accurately requires
intense concentration, and acute powers
of memory. Notwithstanding this, China has
been a center of culture and intellectual activity
from her first appearance upon the stage of
history.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the earliest period, the social and political
system of the Chinese has been based upon
educational qualifications. All political dignities,
honors and preferments, by unalterable
law and usage depend upon the educated abilities
and scholarship of candidates for office.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rank of mandarin comes by no hereditary
right, nor by favor of a sovereign, but
through severe intellectual effort. If in some
cases this is obtained through corruption and
bribery of some clever scholar who sells his
literary privileges to some richer competitor,
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'>[44]</span>this does not alter the case; honors still go to
scholarship.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said of these successful men, the true
students, that it would be difficult to parallel
them in any country for readiness with the pen
and retentive memory. If they are not highly
educated, it is due to their false system of educational
merit, which consists in an undue
exercise of the memory at the expense of the
thinking powers. It is also due to the fact
that it is a stereotyped system, based upon an
ancient usage and custom, concerned with the
past and ancient tradition rather than present
or future progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early history of this people is specially
interesting in the light of recent discoveries.
These suggest, and the suggestions are confirmed
in the ancient literature of the Chinese,
that at a period about B. C. 2500, these people
made their first appearance in China from some
locality south of the Caspian Sea, in western
Asia. This is supposed, from certain historical
correspondences, to have been Susiana, and
that their emigration was the result of political
disturbances occurring throughout western Asia
at that date. That, driven from their early
home, they wandered eastward, finally settling
in the fertile districts of Shansi and Honan,
near the Yellow river. About the same time,
other families of this people settled to the south
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'>[45]</span>in Annim, from whence these kindred people
finally spread over all China.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they first came into the country, they
found there aboriginal tribes of various races.
In their historical annals the most important
of these primitive inhabitants are referred to as
the “Kwei people.” It is said of these that
they practiced the art of writing and possessed
a literature which is referred to by the Chinese
as the “Kwei Books,” which included a treatise
on music. M. de Lacouperie conjectures
these primitive people to be of the Aryan stock,
of whom remnants are to be found at the present
day in Cambodia.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Chinese came into the land they
had a culture of their own. They were advanced
in the industrial arts and they possessed
a system of writing and a literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>They date the origin of writing with them
to a mythical emperor, Hwang-le, who invented
the art, selecting for this purpose objects in
the air, and on the earth, and in the world
around, substituting these representations or
symbols of things for the knotted cords then
in use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Modern Chinese writing gives but a faint
suggestion of a derivation from ancient pictographs.
These, however, can be traced by referring
to archaic forms of these characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, in Chinese words formed by two characters,
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'>[46]</span>the one representing the sound, and the
other the key which indicates the sound, these
two characters are so imposed, the one upon
the other, as in a modern monogram, or are so
closely associated, that to the uninitiated they
appear as one character.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, however, these characters are separated,
they bear often distinct resemblance to
objects, and in the archaic forms of these characters
their picture origin is distinctly apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. S. W. Williams, in his work “The Middle
Kingdom,” Vol. I, has illustrations, showing
fine examples of archaic and modern forms
of Chinese characters that are in evidence of
the pictorial origin of the Chinese system.</p>

<p class='c000'>The references to the mythical emperor,
Hwang-le, who, according to Chinese annals,
invented their system of writing, seems to have
antedated the appearance of this people in China.
In their historical literature, his name is
written Nak-hon-ti, and he is so nearly identical
in name, character and works to the Susian
deity, Nak-hun-ti, that the two are evidently
the same. This correspondence suggests the
early association of the Chinese with the families
of the same race who inhabited Susiana in
primitive times, which continue in the names
of other heroes common to Accadian legends
and the annals of the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'>[47]</span>Again, the accordance of the Chaldean and
Chinese chronology in astronomical and other
scientific data cannot be regarded as accidental.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among many remarkable parallelisms in the
literature of both races are the astrological
chapters of the “She King,” the most ancient
of the dynastic histories of the Chinese, and
an astrologic chapter in an Accadian document.
These have been translated by Professor
Sayce, from the cuneiform, who finds
constant occurrence of the same expressions
in both records relating to particular forecasts,
connected with certain planets, as “Soldiers
arise,” “Gold is exchanged,” and many others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the division of the Chinese empire by
the Emperor Yaou into twelve portions, governed
by twelve “Pastor Princes,” in imitation
of the feudal system of ancient Susa, is
another evidence of the former association or
close contact of these distinct people.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the literature of the Chinese there is a
work for which they claim the highest antiquity.
Until recently no clew had been found
for its interpretation. This was the “Yih
King,” or “Book of Changes,” which has
been a sealed mystery to the ablest Chinese
scholars of all ages, including Confucius. Its
interpretation has, however, been accomplished
by M. de Lacouperie who finds this work
to be a collection of syllabaries such as are
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'>[48]</span>common in Accadian literature. These are
interspersed with chapters on astronomical and
astrological lore. Others again, refer to the
ethnology of primitive inhabitants of the country;
all of these, however, taking the form
of vocabularies only possible to interpret by
recognizing their syllabic character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of this work in ancient Chinese
literature is explained in two ways. Prof.
Douglas regards this as an evidence that in by-gone
ages this language was polysyllabic. He
points to the fact that certain words indicate a
former polysyllabism and from this infers that
the language as it now appears is an example
of phonetic decay. Others, on the contrary,
see in the occasional but rare evidences of agglutination,
the influence of contact with other
races speaking an agglutinative or polysyllabic
tongue, and of which the above example in
their ancient literature is perhaps a literary remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is incredible that a race so advanced in
polysyllabism as evidenced by the “Yih King,”
or “Book of Changes,” could revert to so pure
a monosyllabism as is now presented by the
Chinese language. Phonetic decay is possible
to many words in a language, but so general a
reversion to primitive conditions is scarcely
possible of a whole language.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reference has been made in the Chinese system
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'>[49]</span>of writing to their use of picture forms or
ideographic signs, in association with the phonograms
to explain the meaning or particular
use of these signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>This principle, so often referred to, is by no
means a special invention of the Chinese, but
as we shall see, occurs in all original pictorial
systems of writing with the development of
phonetism. This is, that when phonetic values
begin to attach themselves to the primitive
ideographs, these are retained and attached to
the signs expressing the primitive sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As if,” says Prof. Sayce, “to assist the
memory in remembering the meaning and pronunciation
of a particular word.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In this way evidently the “keys” of the
Chinese system had their origin, as also the
determinatives of the cuneiform, the hieroglyphic
systems of the Egyptians, the Maya or
Mexican, and other pictorial systems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the many advantages obtained from
a purely syllabic, or purely alphabetic system
of writing is the easy adjustment of these signs
to various forms of speech. This is eminently
true of alphabetic systems. On the other hand
the application of non-alphabetic characters to
other than the original language to which these
were adapted is by no means so simple and
manageable in results.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen how the Chinese, by the simple
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'>[50]</span>use of the phonogram and the ideogram,
were enabled by the structure of their language
to retain this form without variation through
the ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tendency in polysyllabic languages after
reaching the phonetic stage, was to greater
complexity and an increase of explanatory signs
in systems of writing. Sometimes the transmissions
of these primitive systems from one
race to another, led to simpler methods.</p>

<p class='c000'>It, however, not infrequently happened that
these transmissions led to greater complexity.
This depended somewhat upon the diversity
between the languages spoken by the authors
of the primitive system of writing and those
who adopted it.</p>

<p class='c000'>While speech and mode of writing are distinct
and independent, the one of the other,
the influence of language structure in the evolution
of graphic systems is conspicuous. Thus
a sentence of English speech might be expressed
by Chinese characters or Egyptian hieroglyphics.
In the Tel Armana tablets, more
than one language appears in the cuneiform.
We have seen how the so called Hittite characters
were found on occasion yielding Greek
words, and the use of the Roman alphabet for
French, German, Italian and other languages,
are every day examples.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact however remains, that in the process
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'>[51]</span>of the development of primitive systems of
writing, before the use of an alphabet, the influence
of language structure upon the systems
of writing is an important factor in the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious phenomenon in the history of human
speech is the preference shown by certain
families of language for special combinations
of vowels and consonants. The simplest combination
is of a single vowel with a preceding
consonant in the formation of syllables. For
instance, such words as Ho-no-lu-lu, Mi-ka-do
and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese form their syllables only in this
way. The same is true of Polynesian dialects
and also certain families of language in Africa
south of the Equator.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some distinguished philologists suggest this
relation of consonant and vowel as survivals
of the original elements of speech; an example,
perhaps, in language, of “the line of least resistance.”
It is easier to utter <i>sa</i> than <i>as</i>, <i>ta</i>
than <i>at</i>, and so on. However this may be, it
is a notable fact that certain families of speech
form their syllables only in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the Semitic languages are alone in
their use of three consonants in the formation
of root words; three consonants with their complementary
vowels and no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other languages form their syllables with
every possible combination of consonants and
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'>[52]</span>vowels, some showing a preference for the consonants,
others for the vowels, while again
others combine their syllables as the case may
be, showing no decided preferences for special
combinations of vowels and consonants.</p>

<p class='c000'>These conditions have had their influence on
the development of graphic systems. In the
simplest combination of a consonant and vowel,
as <i>sa</i>, <i>se</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>su</i>, if the combining power
is only one way and never another, as <i>as</i>, <i>es</i>, <i>is</i>,
<i>os</i>, <i>us</i>, the number of syllables that can be formed
in such a language are few, and the number
of signs to express these are consequently limited.
But when the combining power is both
ways, the number of possible syllables increases
with every increase of these combinations of
vowels and consonants, and the number of
signs correspondingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The transmission of the Chinese system of
writing to the Japanese, which occurred about
the third century, B. C., indicates this influence
of language structure towards simplicity.
The Japanese language is polysyllabic. No
syllable contains more than one vowel, with a
single preceding consonant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the adoption by the Japanese of the Chinese
characters in the Ka-ta-ka-na syllabary, a
certain number of phonograms were selected
which would give the sound of the unions of
consonants and vowels in the Japanese language.
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'>[53]</span>As spoken, this includes five vowels
and fifteen consonants. As these combine only
in one way there are but seventy-five possible
combinations of vowels and consonants in this
language. As some of these possible combinations
never occur, the use of forty-five of these
syllabic signs are all that is necessary to form
any word in the Japanese language, with the
Ka-ta-ka-na syllabary.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the formation of this syllabary the ideographic
characters of the Chinese system were
found unnecessary and were rejected. The
result has been one of the best syllabaries that
has ever been constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese have another syllabary, the
Hi-ra-ka-na, derived from a cursive script of
the Chinese. This syllabary, however, is more
complicated, including with the syllabics a
greater number of signs as variants, and homophones,
in all nearly three hundred; a marked
contrast to the simplicity of the other. It is,
however, one among the many instances we
have in the evolution of letters, where the simpler
way seems so easy and evident, but yet is
not recognized.</p>

THE path of our alphabet seems to be
taking us far afield when we turn to
Chinese systems of writing and to
the origin and development of cuneiform. Nevertheless,
it is in this course that some of the
richest developments have appeared and the
greatest rewards have been obtained by scholars
in this special direction of research.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the narrative given of the decipherment
of cuneiform writing reference was made to
the three distinct combinations of the arrow-headed
or wedge-shaped characters in the trilingual
inscriptions at first deciphered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was found that these three distinct combinations
of cuneiform signs represented three
languages of three distinct races of men, the
Persian, an Aryan people speaking an inflectional
language; the Assyro-Babylonians, Semitic
people who spoke a language related to
the Hebrew, and the third a Turanian people
who spoke an agglutinative language, allied to
that of the modern Turks or Finns.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was some time after the decipherment of
the Persian version of the cuneiform texts before
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'>[56]</span>these facts became fully understood. The
Semitic text presented unusual difficulties,
while the language of the other version remained
for a time unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discoveries of Mr. Layard, shortly after,
on the site of ancient Nineveh, were to throw
more light upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the unearthing of the royal palace of
Assur-bani-pal, at Keyunji, the remains of the
great library founded by this monarch were
discovered beneath the ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>These remains consisted of more than twenty
thousand bricks, tablets and cylinders, some
of which were in fragments, but a greater part
entire, and the inscriptions thereon as distinct
as when first impressed in the soft clay.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a fine, tenacious clay of the region
which had been moulded into bricks and cylinders
of various sizes, upon which when moist
the cuneiform letters had been impressed by a
wooden or metal stylus. They had then, for
the greater part, been hardened by a slow fire,
and were thus made practically indestructible.
These cuneiform books were soon distributed
in the great libraries and museums of Europe,
and thus became accessible to scholars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among these literary documents were found
a large number which consisted of translations,
either interlinear or in parallel passages, from a
non-Semitic language into Assyro-Babylonian.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'>[57]</span>It appeared in two dialects, the speech of the
early people of northern Babylonia—the people
of Accad—and the speech of the primitive inhabitants
of southern Babylonia—the people of
Sumir or Shinar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The close alliance of the peoples of Accad
and Sumir in race and language has led to the
general application of the name of Accadians
to both families. A closer distinction in general
terms now adopted by scholars is Sumerian.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further discoveries rapidly following the unearthing
of the Ninevite tablets, confirmed the
evidences that these people were the inventors
of cuneiform, and that the Sumerian dialect
represented the most ancient of the cuneiform
scripts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the oldest inscriptions which have yet been
found the characters are hardly as yet cuneiform.
The lines are straight and simple, resembling
somewhat the strokes and dashes appearing
in words spelled by the electric telegraphic
code.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arrangement of these is pictorial, forming
picture hieroglyphics, and these were found
to be ideographic and not phonetic.</p>

<p class='c000'>By degrees the wedge-shaped and arrow-headed
characters appear, the pictorial forms
are not so distinct and these characters express
sound as well as ideas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story revealed by these older inscriptions
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'>[58]</span>was a genuine surprise to scholars. It not only
presented the remoter occupation of Mesopotamia
by a hitherto unknown people, but also
that while to Mesopotamia is to be accorded
the distinction as the “mother land” of the
arts and sciences, it was not to its Semitic inhabitants,
the Assyrians and Babylonians of
history, that this is due.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, long before the appearance of a Semitic
people in the land, scientific applications to the
industrial arts were abundant. An extensive
system of irrigation and canals were in use in
the arid regions and drainage for the low lands
near the sea. The arts of metallurgy were
practised. Mathematics and geometry were
applied to structures, and astronomy to measurements
of time and planetary movements.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were builders of cities. As we have
seen, they had invented a system of writing.
In certain cities they had schools for scribes,
and they had libraries where the literature thus
developed was collected.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we learn that this testimony takes us
back to a date older than the pyramids and to
the earlier Egyptian dynasties, we may well
exclaim at the astonishing facts archæology is
presenting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until recently there were no evidences of a
civilization in Babylonia which approached the
antiquity of Egyptian monuments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'>[59]</span>In 1883, Dr. Taylor placed the earliest dates
from the cuneiform at between 2700 and 3000,
B. C. Recent discoveries, however, refer back
to a period, according to Prof. Hilfrecht, at
least three milleniums earlier, and point to a
civilization distinct and original with the Turanian
races of Asia preceding that of other
races and people in these regions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mesopotamia, “The land between the rivers,”
is a tract of country extending about seven
hundred miles from its northernmost boundaries,
near the mountains of Armenia, to the
southernmost limit, the Persian Gulf. A range
of hills crosses this region near the center, running
east and west, from the Euphrates to the
Tigris. North of these hills the country is the
ancient Assyria, with its capital, Nineveh, situated
on the Tigris. South of these hills to
the Persian Gulf, is the ancient Babylonia, or
Chaldea, where, on the Euphrates, its later
capital, Babylon, was situated.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the more ancient records Assyria appears
as “Accad,” or “Agade;” the southern portion,
or Babylonia, as “Sumir,” or the land
of “Shinar,” and later as Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the greater portion, this region is a dead
level, its monotony unbroken but for the rich
verdure of the lands bordering upon these great
rivers, and the long lines of slightly elevated
embankments marking the course of ancient,
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'>[60]</span>or more recent canals, and the solitary mounds
rising here and there from the plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the sites of ancient temples and
cities and are sometimes very extensive. The
mounds of Warka, the ancient Erech, are nearly
six miles in circumference and in some places
rise to the height of one hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great mound of Koyunjik covers an area
of over one hundred acres in extent, and is
ninety-five feet high at its most elevated point.
That of Nippur, with the ruins of the great
temple of Bel, rose over one hundred feet above
the plain. Others are smaller, and sometimes
were intended to support but one palace or
temple.</p>

<p class='c000'>These mounds are artificial, their foundations
consisting of earth mixed with burned
bricks in alternate layers, the whole encased
by a wall of bricks cemented with bitumen, or
as in Assyria, where stone could be obtained,
by a facing of stone masonry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon these artificial hills or mounds, the inhabitants
of Mesopotamia, from the most remote
to later times, built their cities, their palaces,
their temples and other important structures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heavy rains of the winter season coursing
down these declivities for so many centuries,
have in places worn deep ravines in the
mounds, through which the torrents have carried
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'>[61]</span>the crumbling debris far out upon the
plain. In this way many valuable relics have
come to light; bits of pottery, inscribed bricks,
seals and cylinders, the form and style of the
inscriptions upon some of these indicating great
antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>These indications of greater antiquity include
inscriptions on bricks for building purposes as
well as those used for record and literature.
They include also the form and character of
the inscriptions, whether archaic or later cuneiform,
and again the use of bitumen or cement
in masonry.</p>

<p class='c000'>In primitive times the first bricks which succeeded
the mud wall were sun-dried and were
laid up with reeds and plastered with soft mud
or bitumen. This bitumen was applied hot
and adhered so firmly to the bricks that it is almost
impossible to break them apart to obtain
the cement and is one cause why the masonry
consisting of sun-dried bricks has in many cases
withstood the ages. Later the sun-dried bricks
came to be used only for interior walls, while
for the outer walls bricks were made from selected
clay and were carefully prepared and
burned, forming bricks of superior quality and
strength. So well have these withstood the
ravages of time that some of the mounds, notably
those of the later Babylonian period, are
veritable quarries of building brick.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'>[62]</span>It is stated that the bricks of which the temples
and palaces of Babylon were built, have
for the past two thousand years supplied cities
of the surrounding region with the material
used in the construction of public and private
edifices, and that certain families of the Babili
tribe, who claim to be direct descendants of the
Babylonians, are exclusively employed in quarrying
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been stated, bitumen was used for
laying the masonry in the remoter times long
before Babylon was built. Of this substance
an abundant supply was to be obtained at various
places in southern Mesopotamia, near the
Arabian desert, notably in the neighborhood
of Ur, now Mugheir, “the bitumened,” so
called from the bitumenous springs of the vicinity.
In time, the use of this for masonry
gave place to a fine white mortar made from a
peculiar calcareous clay, found near the Arabian
frontier to the west of the Euphrates in
southern Mesopotamia, which for lightness and
strength has never been surpassed.</p>

<p class='c000'>These evidences, including also the inscriptions
originally stamped upon the bricks, with
the name of the king or ruler under whose orders
they had been prepared, furnish indications
of their time and place in history.</p>

<p class='c000'>It thus came about that explorers following
the work of Botta, Layard, George Smith and
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'>[63]</span>others, found their way to sites more ancient
by many centuries than the beginnings of Nineveh
or Babylon, and have obtained from these
records of great historical importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The more ancient of these sites are in the
southern portion of the country, in that region
anciently known as Sumir, or Shinar, and later
as Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was on the lower courses of the great
rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, towards the
Persian Gulf. This region abounds with the
ruins of ancient cities as yet unexplored. The
most important of the cities of this region were
Eridu, the most ancient and sacred, now marked
by the mud heaps of Abu Sharein; the city
of Ur, now Mugheir, once a maritime and
commercial city of these earlier times, and of
special interest as that “Ur of the Chaldees,”
the early home of Abraham; Nippur, or Neffur,
the seat of older Bel; Tel-Loh, the ancient
Sirgulla, and Larsa.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sites of Ur and Eridu, once near the sea,
are now far inland. Eridu, formerly directly
upon the shores of the Persian Gulf, is now
one hundred and fifty miles distant, while Ur,
once situated at the mouth of the Euphrates,
is now about one hundred and fifty miles distant
from the sea, and about six miles to the
west of the present course of the Euphrates on
the western banks of the older bed of the river,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'>[64]</span>nearly opposite the point—though six miles
away—where the Shat-el-Hic enters the Euphrates
from the east, as it approaches from its
source in the Tigris.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is estimated that the alluvium brought
down by these great rivers has encroached upon
the Persian Gulf by the formation of land about
sixty feet annually, creating a delta at the head
of the gulf of ninety miles in three thousand
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>These deposits have been more rapid in later
times than anciently. The great cause of the
difference between ancient and modern Chaldea
is the neglect of the water courses. In
ancient times, a well arranged system of embankments
and irrigating canals held these
great rivers in their courses by distributing the
superabundant waters of the great flood times
to all parts of the country, thus enriching the
soil with abundant water supply at all seasons.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the present neglected condition of this
region the floods as they come down from the
mountain sources of the Euphrates are liable
to wash away the banks, sometimes changing
the course of the river, and overflowing large
tracts at slightly lower levels, which have become
unwholesome marshes, while other large
tracts which are never inundated, in the fierce
heats become parched and desolate sand wastes.
It is said that such is the spread and waste of
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'>[65]</span>the Euphrates in its lower course, that, except
in flood time, but a small proportion of
this great volume of water reaches the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>These conditions do not so seriously affect
the Tigris, which for the greater part of its
course flows over a rocky bed, between high
embankments, and which, though a narrower,
is a deeper and swifter stream than the Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within historic times, the Tigris and Euphrates
entered the sea by separate channels nearly
thirty miles apart. At the present time, and
for many centuries, these two rivers have been
united, forming the great river, the Shat-el-Arab,
through which, in a course of about one
hundred and twenty miles, their united waters
reach the sea.</p>

creation.—Hail to thee, oh Amen-Râ, whose seat is Egypt’s
double throne!—Thou art the prince in Southern Thebes,—Grand
sovereign in thy realm.—Thou goest through the Southern
land,—And nations call thee lord, Arabia calls thee prince.—Thou
Ancient One of Heaven, and Oldest One of Earth,—Who
didst produce existences and govern things, doest still support
creation.—Thou art unchangeable amid the changes of the
gods.—Thou art benign, a ruler of the heavenly cycle,—Yea,
lord of all the deities,—The prince of truth and sire of the
gods.</p>

THE immense antiquity suggested in
the maritime conditions at Ur and
Eridu is again emphasized by the astronomical
tablets. At this remote date it appears
that these ancient Turanian Chaldeans
had traced the yearly course of the sun among
the stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twelve constellations forming the signs
of the zodiac had also been established by them,
with the significations which have continued
to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had divided the year into twelve
months, and the first month of their year—which
began with the vernal equinox—was
named for the constellation, or zodiacal sign,
which opened the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was Taurus, whose figure appears in
these ancient calendars as leading the months
at the beginning of the year. At the time this
was prepared the sun was in Taurus at the
vernal equinox. About 2500 B. C., the sun
entered Aries at this period of the year, while
the date when the sun entered Taurus at the
vernal equinox was 4700 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'>[68]</span>Other evidences from these principal cities
of southern Mesopotamia, present, in the remoter
times, this land of Sumir as a populous,
fertile, well watered and cultivated country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was divided into small states, each surrounding
a city containing a temple devoted to
the service of certain astral divinities, as Ur,
the city of the Moon God; or Larsa, with its
Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near these temples, and accessible from them
were the Zigguratas, the temple observatories
for astronomical and astrological studies.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had also priestly colleges, schools for
scribes, and libraries as at Erech, which was
known as the “City of Books.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These small states with their cities, were in
the earliest times each governed by “patesi,”
priest-kings, corresponding to the “pastor
princes” of ancient China, or the Horsheshu,
of ancient Egypt. Later on as certain of these
priest kings became more powerful, the neighboring
states and cities came under their domination,
until finally we find all southern Mesopotamia
ruled by kings of Sumir, and northern
Mesopotamia by kings of Accad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the explorations which have been undertaken
of these older cities of Chaldea, the most
extensive are those which have occurred on the
sites of the ancient Nippur and at Tel-Loh, the
ancient Shirpulla.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'>[69]</span>The former excavations, which have been
conducted under the auspices of the University
of Pennsylvania, since the year 1888 to the
present date, have recovered the most ancient
remains as yet discovered of these older civilizations,
dating, as estimated by Prof. Hilfrecht,
from a period about 7000 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>This includes the enormous structure dedicated
to the older Bel, which had been rebuilt
by successive monarchs, its later ruins rising
to a height of over one hundred feet above the
plain, while its lower foundations reach as great
a depth below.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this and other great buildings in the
vicinity were obtained sacrificial vessels, marble
and silver vases, objects in gold and bronze,
stone door sockets and over thirty thousand
clay tablets.</p>

<p class='c000'>These include remains from the earliest periods
of civilization to the latest Babylonian
history, from the earliest primitive Sumerian
rulers to the latest Semitic kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>They give records of powerful kings as rulers
of Accad during the two milleniums preceding
the reigns of the great Sargon and his son,
Naram-Sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these two monarchs a great number of inscribed
objects have been obtained, some of the
most important relics as yet discovered verifying
inscriptions found elsewhere of the extent
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'>[70]</span>of their power. Remains were also found here
of later kings of Ur and other cities of this region,
whose names elsewhere appear as great
builders or restorers of ancient temples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this earlier period, that of the “patesi,”
or priest kings, some very wonderful records
have been discovered by M. de Sarzec at Tel-Loh.
The group of mounds of which Tel-Loh
is the chief, is the site of a very ancient city
in southern Mesopotamia, the ancient Zirgul,
or Sirgulla. It is situated between the Tigris
and Euphrates, near the junction of the former
river with the Shat-el-Hic, a small river which
flows southwesterly to the Euphrates, connecting
the waters of these two great rivers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mound of Tel-Loh, “The Mound of
the Idol,” formed part of the royal quarter of
the ancient city, rising at this point forty feet
above the plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in this locality that, in 1880-1881, M.
de Sarzec, French consul at Bagdad, who was
carrying on excavations in this region under
the direction of the French government, came
upon ten statues in the ruins of a very ancient
structure.</p>

<p class='c000'>This proved to be the royal residence of an
ancient king of Zirgul, the patesi, or priest-king
Gudea, whose date is fixed by various
authorities at about 4800 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statues were nearly life size, and all
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'>[71]</span>were headless. Two heads soon after were
found in the ruins, one of them turbaned and
the other uncovered and shaved, supposed to
represent the king as priest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The type of feature reproduced in these finely
sculptured heads is unmistakably Turanian,
of the Tartar branch of this great family, while
the turban, another characteristic indication in
costume, might serve for a copy in sculpture
of the head dress worn by some living representative
of this race in central Asia at the
present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these statues were inscribed; nine of them
with memorials of Gudea, and the tenth of Urbahu,
an earlier king who ruled in Zirgul before
Gudea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ruins of his palace were found by M. de
Sarzec below the palace of Gudea, and also the
foundations of an ancient pyramid temple first
erected by Urbahu and rebuilt by Gudea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions were in very archaic cuneiform
and were incised upon the robes of the
figures. Upon the principal statue of Gudea
were inscribed three hundred and thirty-six
lines of writing, divided into nine columns.
About one hundred and thirty characters are
used, and these texts represent the longest of
the ancient cuneiform writings found.</p>

<p class='c000'>The material of the statues is a peculiar variety
of granite, a dark green diorite, one of the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'>[72]</span>hardest of stones. This was nowhere to be
found in Mesopotamia. So far as known, it
only appears in the peninsula of Sinai.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the facility and skill in the manipulation
of the material has indicated that the
tools used for the work must have been of the
hardest metals. They are supposed to have
been of the hardest bronze. But this presupposes
an amazing antiquity for the practice of
metallurgy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The replies to the question, from whence the
bronze? are now abundant, and come from a
variety of sources, but the testimony from the
inscriptions of the statues is the most direct
and ample, opening before us a commercial
intercourse between nations and people of these
regions scarcely suspected of such very remote
dates.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are indications that even in these early
days tin from Cornwall was exported to these
far off regions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions relate chiefly to the building
of a pyramid temple by Urbahu, and on
the Gudea statues to the rebuilding of the temple
by this later prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring constantly to himself as patesi, or
priest-king, he says that for this purpose his
God, Nin-Girsu, has opened the way for him
“from the sea of the highlands,”—the Persian
Gulf—“to the upper sea,” the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'>[73]</span>“I,” says Gudea, “made the lordly temple
of the God who enlightens the darkness; of
costly woods I made it for him; with wood
from Lebanon (Amanus); wood of seventy and
fifty cubits. I raised its roof twenty-five cubits
high.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From the copper and silver mines of the
Taurus, near “the great pass,” “the gate of
Syria,” copper was brought for the great pillars.
Marble also from the “Mountain of
Canaan,” (Tidalum), in Phœnicia, for the
foundations. He sent ships to upper Egypt,
where gold was obtained for the porch of the
temple. “To the country of Gubi and to the
country of Nituk which possesses every kind
of tree, vessels to be laden with all sorts of
trees for Sippara I have sent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sippara, “The City of the Bright Flame,”
was another name by which Zirgul was known.
Reference to this comes in the inscriptions
concerning the “God who enlightens the darkness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then of his statues he says: “Strong stone
being brought from Magan (Sinaitic peninsula)
I made an image therewith that my name may
be remembered gloriously.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again of this statue he says: “Neither in
silver, nor in copper, nor in tin, nor in bronze
let any one undertake the execution. An image
yielding none of these no man will demand
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'>[74]</span>as spoil; made of hard stone may it remain in
the place thereof, forever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These statues thus had a peculiar religious
significance. Placed in the sacred temple, always
before the god to whose service they
were dedicated, they were supposed to represent
the king constantly in life, and like the
“Ka” statues of the Egyptian kings, to be
the residence of the soul of the departed prince
which was thus ever reverently before his god.
Thus we can understand the terrible curse pronounced
by Gudea upon whosoever should remove
this statue from its place.</p>

<p class='c000'>This and the companion statues from Tel-Loh,
were nevertheless sent to Paris and placed
in the Louvre, where they will receive more
distinction than has been accorded them for
ages. Perhaps this, and also the fact that the
inscriptions on them could not be read until
they were placed where competent Assyriologists
could have access to them, may induce
the Ka of Gudea to revoke his maledictions
should they threaten this later disturber of his
repose.</p>

<p class='c000'>However this may be, the view thus given
of this far off time, of which we have no trace
in history, is one of the most interesting archæological
discoveries of the century.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, long ages before the time of Hiram,
king of Tyre, the friend of David and Solomon;
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'>[75]</span>long ages even before the days of Abraham,
the ships of Gudea were navigating the
seas from the trading ports of Ur and Eridu,
then at the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian
Gulf; coasting down the shores of the
Arabian peninsula, which they circumnavigated,
into the waters of the Red Sea; sailing
northward to Magan, “the enclosed port,” on
the peninsula of Sinai, where the diorite for
the statues was obtained, and perhaps copper
also from the Wady Magarah, “the land of
bronze;” then to various trading ports of the
Egyptian coasts, for gold from Meroe, and for
timber from Ethiopia, and then for the return
voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other confirmation of the trade communications
of southern Mesopotamia with the peninsula
of Sinai appears in the beautiful statue of
Kephren, the builder of the second pyramid,
now in the Boulak museum. This statue was
recently exhumed from the sands of the desert
near the great Sphynx in Egypt, and is of stone
so similar to the diorite of the Tel-Loh statues
that it is evident they were both obtained from
the same source.</p>

<p class='c000'>We know in this connection, that Seneferu,
a predecessor of Kephren, had conquered and
held in possession the Sinaitic peninsula with
a strong garrison of Egyptian troops, which
were maintained here during his reign and the
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'>[76]</span>reign of his immediate successors; that under
this protection the fine stone of this region was
quarried, and that at Wady Margarah the rich
mines of copper, turquoise and other precious
stones were worked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another evidence of the contact of Gudea
with Egypt is the fact that on the lap of the
principal statue of Gudea the plan of the city
is carved, and the scale of measurement used
is the “pyramid inch,” instead of the Babylonian
or Chaldean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aside from this, the finish, detail and workmanship
of the Tel-Loh statues is so similar
in style and character to the statue of Kephren
that they all suggest the same influence and
the same school of sculpture.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many evidences from other sources
of the commercial intercourse between the Babylonians
and Egyptians at these early dates,
and it is probable that the cities of Eridu and
Ur may have maintained the same relations in
the prehistoric commerce of the Persian Gulf
which obtained in later times with Tyre and
Sidon on the Mediterranean. The commercial
horizon thus opening before us is a broad one
but is constantly extending.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natural depressions of the Mesopotamian
valley extend from the Persian Gulf northerly
and northwesterly, thence through the Orontes
valley to the Mediterranean. In prehistoric
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'>[77]</span>times and for long ages this was “the highway
of nations,” by the great rivers, the Tigris
and Euphrates, from sea to sea, the chief trade
route between India and the western coasts of
Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solomon is said to have founded Tadmor in
the Desert for the extensive trade from the
Euphrates, by Damascus to Jerusalem, whence
the rich stuffs and spices from India were conveyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later on, Nebuchadnezzer established the
port of Teredon, on the Persian Gulf, for the
commerce brought from the southern seas destined
for the great waterways, the Tigris and
Euphrates, northwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>These facts are comparatively modern history
to Gudea and his days, when the waters of
the Persian Gulf washed the shores at Eridu,
while ships from India, Ceylon and the different
trading ports on the Red Sea unloaded their
cargoes on the docks of the great maritime city
of Ur of the Chaldees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city of Ur, then not far from the mouth
of the Euphrates, was situated upon its western
shores, and was at this time, and later, a
city of great commercial and political importance,
and the first capital of the kings of all
Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in all maritime cities trading with distant
countries, people of various nationalities were
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'>[78]</span>gathered here. It is not improbable that the
name of “Ur of the Chaldees” may have reference
to certain families of foreign stock, the
“Kaldai” or “Kaldi” who inhabited the regions
round and about Ur, perhaps nomadic
tribes from Arabia. Other authorities, however,
speak of these “Kaldai” as a priest class,
magicians and astrologers, possessing strange
learning and speaking a peculiar language; as
representatives also of the primitive inhabitants
of the country, filling a sacred office and consulted
by the king on all religious subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The divinity of this city was Hurki, or Sin,
the great Moon God, and here may be seen at
the present day on the mounds of Mugheir the
remains of an ancient temple dedicated to this
deity, rising to the height of seventy feet above
the plain. This was founded by Urukh, or
Ur Gur, one of the earliest known of the kings
of united Sumir, who exercised dominion over
the greater portion of southern Mesopotamia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remains of temples built by him are
found in all the larger of the ancient cities of
this region and the enormous proportions of
these and their number have won for him the
name of “The Builder.” It is evident that
this king had at his command vast resources
in human skill and industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bowariyeh mound at Warka is described
as two hundred feet square and one hundred
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'>[79]</span>feet high and that above thirty million bricks
must have gone into its construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other structures on a similar scale, the remains
of which are found at Erech, Larsa,
Calneh, Ur, Nippur and other cities in this
region, show the magnitude of his resources
and the extent of his authority. These buildings
are, for the most part, temples dedicated
to the tutelar divinity of each special locality,
as at Larsa, where he erected a temple to the
Sun God, and at Calneh to Belus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distinguishing features of his structures
which were continued in the later Babylonian
temples, are the rectangular base, the peculiar
orientation of these with their angles to the
cardinal points, the rise in receding stages,
the sloped walls, the buttresses for increased
strength, the drains for the ventilation of the
walls, the external staircases for ascent and the
ornamental shrine crowning the whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temple founded by Ur Gur at Ur, was
originally of great size. It rose in three receding
stages to a vast height, where, upon the
final platform, the temple was placed, containing
the statue of the Moon God, which was
thus visible to a great distance from the surrounding
plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lower stages of this structure were built
of large bricks laid with bitumen. In the upper
stages the masonry is cemented with mortar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'>[80]</span>It appears that this was the work of two
monarchs, Ur Gur, and his son, Dungi, who
as his successor, completed here, as elsewhere,
the buildings unfinished by his father. The
names of both kings are inscribed upon the
bricks in the structure, and on the signet and
clay cylinders found in the ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>These kings, are, however, of later date than
Gudea. In their day the priest kings of one
city had become kings of many, gathering various
localities in Sumir under their dominion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the discoveries obtained during the
explorations at Nippur, by the Babylonian expedition
of the University of Pennsylvania,
there are many relics of Dungi and Urea, or
Ur Gur.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time, there are evidences of an organized
priesthood in whose hands were placed
the religious interests of the king and the people,
who proclaimed to them the will of the
gods as observed in the relations of the planets
and the stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>In more primitive times the religion of this
people was pure Shamanism, a worship of demons
and the evil influences of nature, a religion
common to all Turanian people even at
the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very early, however, in the history of this
people, a recognition of the benign influences
in nature is apparent, and while the older belief
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'>[81]</span>never became entirely extinct, yet the propitious
influences were regarded as attributes
of the higher gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sorcerers and magicians held a power
of their own, but they were subject to the
greater divinities by whose influence their mischiefs
could be averted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether this religious development was
brought about by contact with another race
possessing nobler religious ideals, or was a development
through their scientific applications
of astronomy to astrology, it is impossible to
say. However this may be, these higher religious
conceptions had developed very early
into a cult which became the inheritance of
later races that came into contact with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiar and distinct civilization of these
primitive Babylonians must have continued
through long ages. Their system of writing
had developed from the simple pictorial lines
into the cuneiform and these signs had become
phonetic, expressing sound as well as ideas.
They had also developed a syllabary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, there are evidences of the gradual
increase among them of another race of people.
This was a Semitic people who seem at first to
have established themselves in northern Babylonia
in the kingdom of Accad, finally becoming
supreme in the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>About 3800 B. C., the kingdoms of Accad
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'>[82]</span>and Sumir are found united under Sargon I, a
Semitic king. There are indications of Accadian
or Sumerian kings who ruled over the
separate kingdoms of Accad and Sumir at earlier
and later dates, but the main course of
testimony after Sargon I tells of Semitic kings
as rulers in northern Babylonia, or Accad, and
a Semitic influence dominant there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The influence of such close social contact
brought about material changes in the life,
literature and language of both people.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Accad, which came first under Semitic
influence, the old language rapidly declined.
In Sumir, or southern Mesopotamia, which
continued much longer under the ancient rule
and influence, the old language held its own
down to comparatively recent times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Semites, however, seem to have received
from the Accadians more than they gave. The
arts and sciences and civilization of this ancient
people became the arts and sciences and civilization
of the Semitic Assyrians and Babylonians.</p>

<p class='c000'>They appropriated the religion and gods of
these early Chaldeans. They became heirs of
their literature and they adopted their system
of writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most curious instance in these various
adoptions of the Semites was the Sumerian
syllabary.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'>[83]</span>Now in applying the syllabary of one language
to the uses of another, it might be expected
that the signs expressing a certain syllabic
sound in one language would be used to
express the syllabic sounds in the other. This
however, was not the case in this instance.
When the Semites adopted the old Accadian
syllabary they used these signs quite as often
to express the Semitic sounds of the original
ideographs as for syllabic signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>As an instance of this curious example of
polyphony, Mr. Taylor gives the cuneiform
sign which in the primitive pictorial form represented
an ear. The name of ear in Accadian
is <i>pi</i>. This sign had another syllabic value,
signifying a drop of water. When the Semites
adopted this sign to their uses they retained
the phonetic value of the sign as <i>pi</i>. They,
however, used this sign also to express the
sound of the Semitic words, “eznu,” an ear,
and “giltanu,” a drop of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>This use of signs is the reverse of homophonism,
where by the use of one sign many words
having the same sound are expressed. It is
an instance of polyphonism where one sign is
used to express words having different sounds.
The result was, however, the same. It led in
both cases to the increase of determinatives,
and other explanatory signs to indicate the
word to be expressed by the sign.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'>[84]</span>The use of ideographs as determinatives was
evidently suggested by the Sumerian syllabary,
but the language of the Sumerians was simple,
requiring fewer signs to express sounds. On
the contrary, the Semitic language was more
copious, possessing a greater variety of syllabic
utterances.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will thus be seen that when the decipherment
of the Assyrian cuneiform was first attempted,
scholars could not for a time master
the curious complications they found.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Assyrian syllabary could only be explained
as a foreign importation, not as an evolution
from a Semitic speech. As Professor
Sayce says: “Like the discoverers of the
planet Uranus, they had to presuppose another
language to account for its origin and appearance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The decipherment of the older cuneiform
soon after, and the discovery of the bilingual
texts, where copies from the old Sumerian originals
were placed side by side with the Semitic
translations, soon explained the sources
of confusion, the original values of these signs
and their application to another language.</p>

OF the great rulers in Mesopotamia,
both Turanian and Semitic, who
stand out most distinctly in the records
of this remote past, are the Turanian
prince, Gudea, about 4800 B. C., the great
Sargon I and his son, Naram-Sin, Semitic
princes, both to whom the date 3800 B. C., is
accorded, and the Arabian prince, Khammuragas,
or Hammurabi, the founder of the city
of Babylon and contemporary with Abraham.
The date now given for Sargon I, is 3800 B. C.
Long before this date various families of Semitic
race had evidently made their appearance
in the land; Phœnician traders from the
Persian Gulf, or nomadic tribes from the Arabian
borders, Semitic families, attracted hither
by the rich fertility of the Mesopotamian plains.
These were Sabeans, perhaps, with a faint, far-off
remembrance of the One God, ruler and
creator of the universe, but now worshippers
of the stars, the abodes of ministering spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time in Sargon’s reign, long before
the date accorded to Urea, The Builder, in the
new empire arising in Accad, we find the early
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'>[86]</span>beginnings of the Assyrian people. There was
as yet no Assyria or Assyrians. The ancient
Turanian capital of Accad was named Aushar
or Asshar, signifying “watered plain,” but
this had not yet given its name to the region
or country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sargon’s new capital was Agane, or Agade
of Accad, while Nineveh, “the mighty” of
the coming kingdom, was as yet but a collection
of fishermen’s huts on the swift-flowing
Tigris.</p>

<p class='c000'>As yet there was no kingdom of Babylonia,
and no city of Babylon. This region was situated
in the northern portion of Sumir, south
of Accad, and was at first designated by the
Turanian name, “Gar Dunyash,” or “Kar
Dunyash,” the “Garden of the god, Dunyash.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The site of the future great capital was then
called either by its more ancient Turanian
name, “Tin-Tir-ki,” signifying The Tree of
Life, or its later Accado-Sumerian name, “Ka-Dimmirra,”
Gate of God. In later times this
name translated into Semitic was Babilu—Babylon—which
finally became the name of
the whole of Sumir south to the Persian Gulf,
as Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of Sargon, of Accad, Sumir, or
southern Mesopotamia, was chiefly Turanian.
The displacement of the Mongol peoples by
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'>[87]</span>the Semites in this region had not at this time
obtained. That fusion of races which so distinctly
distinguished the Babylonians of the
later era from the more purely Semitic Assyrians
had scarcely begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Babylonians, as a distinct people under
this name, do not make their appearance on
the stage of history until over fourteen centuries
later than Sargon, in the time or a little
earlier than Hammurabi, or Khammuragas,
about 2300 B. C., at the date accorded to Abraham.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that Semitic people had settled
in this region long previous to the reign of
Sargon, but it was not until the period of Hammurabi,
who at first was simply king of Gar-Dunyash
that the Semitic element dominated
in Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>This powerful prince, who became in time
master of all southern Mesopotamia, was the
founder of the city of Babylon, from which the
country and people received the names Babylonia
and Babylonians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to Sargon, we find in the Ninevite
remains that in this earlier time he had
founded one of the most famous libraries of
ancient Mesopotamia. This was at his new
city of Agane, or Agade. The literature of
this library was entirely based on that of ancient
Sumir. It consisted completely of translations
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'>[88]</span>of these older books into what we may
call Assyrian, or were copies of the older books
in the old language of Sumir.</p>

<p class='c000'>This older language was to these Semitic
Assyrians the language of the learned, the classic
tongue of the time, bearing the same relation
to the Assyrian as do Greek and Latin to
modern literature. It was then even more important
to the Semitic student as it included
all of learning which in Mesopotamia had as
yet obtained literary form.</p>

<p class='c000'>These ancient texts were copied on clay tablets
with translations from the language of Sumir
into Semitic, either between the lines or
the text in the old language in one column
and the translation opposite.</p>

<p class='c000'>For further aids to students, vocabularies
were compiled, giving the Accadian word and
the Assyrian translation; also, syllabic forms,
and it is by these wonderful literary aids, especially
wonderful when we consider their antiquity,
that scholars of to-day are able to read
this ancient Turanian speech as readily as the
Semitic Assyrian language of Sargon’s reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>The systematic methods adopted in this library
are also remarkable. Doubtless Sargon’s
librarians introduced ideas of their own in the
arrangement of this literature, but they had
evidently adopted methods long in use in the
more ancient libraries of Erech, Larsa and
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'>[89]</span>other cities of southern Mesopotamia. As
instances of this literary undertaking the great
work on astronomy and astrology called “The
Observations of Bel,” which long ages after
Berosius translated into Greek, was by order
of Sargon compiled for his library. It consisted
of seventy-two books, and a certain place in
the library was set apart for this. These tablets
were arranged and numbered according to
the subject. A catalogue of these was also
prepared, giving the number of the tablets as
arranged under the subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other literary documents from this collection
are The Story of Creation, in prose and verse;
The Deluge Story, and Adventures of Izdubar,
the famous Nimrod of Hebrew tradition.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the student wished for any special tablet
or subject, he was required by the librarian
to consult the catalogue and to write down the
number of the book he wished for, when it
would be given to him. The librarian of to-day,
to whom the same system and methods
are so familiar, can scarcely claim these as
modern improvements, but may well exclaim
with the philosopher of old, “there is no new
thing under the sun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another great work, prepared for the library
of Sargon, of Agade, was a theological collection
in three books and two hundred tablets.
This consisted of magical texts and incantations
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'>[90]</span>from the primitive religion of Turanian Chaldea,
which still held power and influence as
magic and divination. It included also the
literature of the later development of the Sumerians
into higher spiritual conceptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>This literature of the later period comprised
hymns of praise, invocations to the gods, and
penitential psalms which in spirit and form
bear a remarkable resemblance to the confessions
of the later Hebrew psalmist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps we may trace in this a contact with
Semitic thought and influence long before the
Semites appear as an established people in the
land.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two distinct periods in the religious
development of the Turanians of Chaldea, the
era of Shamanism or demon worship, and later
Sabeanism, the deification of the planets and
the stars or the benign influence of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>As early as Gudea they had entered upon
this later period of religious development, and
now, under the influence of Sargon occurred a
blending of these systems with Semitic conceptions
which continued the established religion
of the Assyrians and Babylonians to the
latest times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latent tendencies of the Semitic mind
seem to have been towards monotheism. While
this did not prevent their recognition of the
gods of the nations with whom they came in
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'>[91]</span>contact, and their frequent adoption of these
as objects of worship, this tendency is yet
manifest.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the later Assyrians, they united in the
adoption of their national deity, Asshur; with
the Moabites, in Chemosh; with the Hebrews,
in Elohim, or Yahveh; and with them all, the
Supreme One who united in Himself the great
attributes of all the gods, the Creator of all
things, the Arbiter of all human events.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Turanian Chaldeans, on the other hand,
were unreserved polytheists. Their gods were
as the sands of the sea for number. Each city,
with its surrounding locality, had its special
god, and the greater the city the greater the
god, the more magnificent the temple dedicated
to his worship, and the more powerful its
priesthood.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the case in the city of Ur, where
Hurud, or Sin, the Moon God, was the local
divinity. There were other moon gods in other
localities, each worshipped in a special way,
but the Moon God of Ur was greater than all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it was with the worship of Ea, the god
of the deep, the local god of the more ancient
city of Eridu; and again of Anu, the Sky God
of Erech.</p>

<p class='c000'>This organization of the Chaldean Pantheon
by Sargon was simply the orderly arrangement
of these into greater and lesser divinities, the
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'>[92]</span>blending of these separate local cults into one
general system.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the head of this pantheon was placed the
Semitic Illu, or El, signifying God, and whose
name is the root word of the Hebrew Elohim
and the Arabian Allah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next in order, was a triad of great gods,
Turanian divinities, consisting of Anu, the Sky
God of Erech; Bel, or Mul-lil, the local god of
Nippur, the Lord of the lower world, and last
in this triad, of Ea, of Eridu, the god of the
great waters, and creator of the Accadean race.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of these gods in this triad is
explained by local circumstances. At the time
of this new arrangement of the Chaldean deities
Erech was a prominent city of southern
Mesopotamia. It had a richly endowed library,
perhaps the greatest collection of literary treasures
at this time known in the ancient world.
This was greatly enlarged by Sargon, who,
perhaps from motives of policy towards his
Chaldean subjects, thought it wisest not to enrich
his library at Agane at the expense of
this the oldest of the libraries of southern Mesopotamia.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also possible that some of the literary
treasures obtained by him in other decaying
cities of this region may have been placed in
the library at Erech for the same reason, as it
offered better opportunities for the safe deposit
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'>[93]</span>of these ancient documents. At any rate, we
find that when Assur-bani-pal founded his
great library at Nineveh many centuries later,
and the ancient cities of Chaldea were ransacked
for their literary treasures, it was at
Erech that he reaped his richest harvest.</p>

<p class='c000'>As suggested, Erech was at the time of Sargon’s
reformation of the gods of Chaldea, a
populous and wealthy city. It possessed a
powerful priesthood devoted to the service of
Anu, the Sky God, the local god of Erech,
who, for these reasons, was placed first in the
trinity of gods, before the more ancient and
sacred divinities of Turanian Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nippur, the second capital of Chaldea, was
also at this time a wealthy and populous city.
Here was located a temple to Belus, the older
Bel, identical with Mul-lil, the Lord of the
lower world, and as the local god of Nippur,
Bel became the second god in the trinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ancient and sacred of all the gods
of ancient Chaldea, Ea, the god of the great
waters, the local divinity of Eridu, was not to
be ignored, and was thus placed in the trinity
of great gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>The triad thus formed represented the gods
of the heavens, the lower world, and the great
waters. Below this was another triad, consisting
of Sin, the moon; Samas, the sun, and
Vul, the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'>[94]</span>Then followed other gods, representing visible
planets, and still below these a host of lesser
nature divinities. The transformation of
some of these gods under Semitic influences,
and their gradual absorption of the attributes
of the older deities is a curious study in Chaldean
mythology.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is of special interest as we find in these
many familiar deities of Syria, Palestine, Egypt
and other countries, who had their origin in
ancient Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>A prominent instance of this is the rise of
Bel-Merodach, the great Baal, from a lesser to
one of the greater gods, and whose cult extended
with the increase of Assyrian and Babylonian
power. When Bel-Merodach comes first
distinctly in view it is as a local god of Babylon.
With the consolidation of all southern
Mesopotamia into the Babylonian empire, and
the establishment of Babylon as its capital, the
local god of this city waxed great with the
greatness and importance of his local abode.
This occurred under Hammurabi, or Khammuragas,
the founder of the city and the empire,
about 2356 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attributes of Bel-Merodach are various.
He is the son of Ea, “The first born of the
gods,” “The benefactor of mankind,” “The
mediator between gods and men,” “The warrior
god, who leads the forces of light.” Like
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'>[95]</span>Nin-Girsu, the god of Gudea, he is the “Lord
of the pure flame, who conquers and puts to
flight the spirits of darkness.” Finally assuming
the attributes of Samas, the Sun God, he
appears as the solar deity of Babylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the cuneiform documents in the
British museum, there is a group of fragments
known as the Assyrian Epic of Creation. Portions
of these were first translated by the late
George Smith, who directed attention to their
peculiar significance. Other fragments have
since been found and translated by Mr. Pinches,
producing the epic nearly complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>In its present form, the poem is probably of
the later days of the Assyrian empire. It bears
within it, however, the embodiment of ancient
Babylonian legends of the origin of things,
and is specially remarkable in certain similarities
to the Hebraic account of creation. A
very great and marked contrast between these
two narratives is that in one case the story of
creation is told by a polytheist, as the effort of
many gods; in the other, by an uncompromising
monotheist, who attributes the work to a
decree of one Supreme God.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Assyrian version of that portion of the
Hebrew narrative: “And the Spirit of God
moved upon the waters, and God said, ‘Let
there be light,’ and there was light,” in the
Chaldean epic is the office of Bel-Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'>[96]</span>As he leads the forces of light against the
powers of darkness he enters into mortal combat
with the great dragon, Tiamat, the goddess
of chaos and darkness. This contest all the
great gods have refused to attempt. In the
conflict which ensues Merodach is victorious,
vanquishing and destroying the great dragon
of chaos. Whereupon there was great rejoicing
among the great gods. Then:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“They established for him the mercy seat of the mighty.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Before his fathers he seated himself for sovereignty.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“O Merodach! thou art glorious among the great gods!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Since that day unchanged is thy command.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus Bel-Merodach, the great son of Ea,
was enthroned.</p>

<p class='c000'>He never becomes the national god of Chaldea,
as Asshur became to Syria. Local influences
were opposed to this. The local deities
of other important cities of southern Mesopotamia,
more ancient and venerated, maintained
their hold upon the affections of their worshippers
to the last.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the case with Mul-lil, the local deity
of Nippur, the second in the triad of great
gods, the older Bel, with whom Bel-Merodach
is sometimes confounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Moon God was to the latest day the
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'>[97]</span>favored divinity of Ur of the Chaldees, and so
of the local deities of other Sumerian cities.</p>

<p class='c000'>These divinities were many of them of great
antiquity. They were reverenced in their special
localities as nowhere else. Thus the indignation
of the priesthoods of these local cults,
and of the local aristocracies, may well be imagined
at the attempt of Nabonidus, the latest
king of Babylon, 555-538 B. C., to concentrate
all these local worships at the city of Babylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they saw their gods taken from their
ancient shrines and gathered at Babylon in the
great temple of Bel, as subordinate gods to
magnify the worship of Bel, their resentment
ripened into secret intrigue against their king,
which resulted in the banishment of Nabonidus
from his kingdom, the occupation of the throne
by Cyrus, and finally the overthrow of the
Babylonian empire.</p>

THIS latest king of Babylon is, however,
an interesting personage. To
him we are indebted for many records
which but for him the archæologists of
this present time would not have recovered.
He was a zealous restorer of ancient temples
and shrines, which in his day had fallen into
decay through all Mesopotamia. This seems
to have been a duty enjoined by the gods upon
all kings of Chaldea. But, whatever his motive,
whether as a fulfillment of religious duty
or of antiquarian inclinations, Nabonidus is
said to have undertaken these restorations to
an extent no king before him seems to have
attempted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of famous temples rebuilded by him are
those of the Moon God of Ur, and Haran; also
of the Sun God at Larsa and of Sippara.</p>

<p class='c000'>The custom of placing the records of the
founder of an edifice in chambers or cavities in
the foundations of the structure is of immense
antiquity. These records were inscribed generally
on clay cylinders and usually ended with
injunctions to any future king who might, in
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'>[100]</span>rebuilding, come upon the secret hiding place
of the cylinders that these records should be
replaced in their original depository with religious
rites. Failing to do this, the wrath of
the gods is invoked upon his sacreligious head.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in this way that Nabonidus came
upon some very ancient and important documents.
As in all cases he followed his discoveries
with the record of the event upon inscribed
cylinders deposited by him in the foundations
of the new structure, the value of these
to later explorers can scarcely be estimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was during his excavations in the foundations
of the Sun temple at Larsa that he
came upon a cylinder inscribed and deposited
by Hammurabi, or Khammuragas, at the rebuilding
of a more ancient temple on the same
site.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hammurabi states upon his cylinder that
this more ancient temple was founded by Urea,
or Ur Gur, seven hundred years before his
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>On annalistic tablets of Babylonian kings in
the British Museum, Khammuragas is mentioned
and the date accorded to him B. C.
2315, or the end of his reign B. C. 2259, which
gives the date of Urea, The Builder, as about
2959 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important of the discoveries of
Nabonidus, was, however, the finding of the
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'>[101]</span>foundation cylinder of Naram-Sin, the son and
successor of the great Sargon of Accad.</p>

<p class='c000'>This occurred at the time of his restoration
of the Sun temple at Sippara, near the ancient
city of Agane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this, Nabonidus says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I brought the Sun God from his temple,
and placed him in another house.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I sought for its old foundation stone, and
eighteen cubits deep—”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I dug into the ground and the foundation
stone of Naram-Sin, Son of Sargon, which for
thirty-two hundred years no king who had
gone before me had seen.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Sun God—the great Lord of E Bara.
Let me see; even me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the discovery of the cylinder of Nabonidus
the date of Sargon of Accad was uncertain.
He had often been regarded as identical
with the later Sargon, the Assyrian king
who carried the Ten Tribes of Israel into captivity
about 722 B. C. The numerous records
remaining of the earlier Sargon had made the
identity of these two monarchs confusing and
impossible, which was cleared away by the
discovery of the records of Nabonidus.</p>

<p class='c000'>This king had data for his statements which
subsequent discoveries have confirmed, thus
giving to Naram-Sin the date of thirty-two
hundred and fifty years before Nabonidus,
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'>[102]</span>which was 550 B. C., and allowing for the long
reign of Sargon I, we have the immense antiquity
of B. C. 3800 for the time of the great
Sargon of Accad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The site where this important discovery was
made is one of the two Sipparas, situated on
opposite sides of the royal canal, not far from
the Euphrates, and running parallel with the
river.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two cities were anciently known by
their rival sanctuaries, the one dedicated to
the worship of the Sun, and the other to the
worship of the Moon, and were known as the
Sippara of the Sun and the Sippara of Annuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sippara of Annuit is the supposed site
of the ancient Agade of Sargon. It was, however,
at Sippara of the Sun that Naram-Sin,
the son of Sargon, founded the temple which
was discovered by Nabonidus and rediscovered
by Mr. Rassam a few years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>While making excavations in a mound near
the supposed site of Sippara, Mr. Rassam made
his way into some rooms of a vast structure
which he found to be a temple. Passing on
from room to room, he at last entered a smaller
chamber which was paved with asphalt. As
this kind of pavement was unusual in Babylonian
and Assyrian structures he concluded
this must be the secret depository of records.
Having broken into the pavement, he came
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'>[103]</span>finally upon a sealed casket or chest of earthenware,
about three feet below the surface, in
which was found a stone tablet, beautifully inscribed,
and also other documents.</p>

<p class='c000'>This stone tablet was the archive of the famous
Sun temple as was proved by the inscription
on it, and also by the documents found
with it, which gave the names of the founder
and the restorers of the temple.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tablet had upon it a representation of
the Sun God, seated upon a throne receiving
the homage of his worshippers, while above
him the sun disc is suspended as from heaven
by two strong cords held up by two ministering
spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscription declares this to be the image
of Shamash, the great Lord who dwells in the
House of the Sun which is within the city of
Sippara.</p>

<p class='c000'>This established at once the site as that of
ancient Sippara, which to this time had been
doubtful, and may lead to further discoveries
of still greater antiquity on the site of the Sippara
of Annuit, the supposed site of the ancient
Agane.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the records remaining of Sargon, from
various localities, it is stated that he built here
a palace, which, after some important military
campaigns he greatly enlarged; that he built
also a magnificent temple to Annuit, and that
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'>[104]</span>afterwards a statue of him (Sargon) was here
erected, inscribed with memorials of his birth
and career.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tablets in the British Museum containing
these records are probably copies of these
older inscriptions, the originals not having as
yet been discovered. They record Sargon’s
invasions of Elam with victorious armies, another
successful campaign in Syria, the subjugation
of all Babylonia and the peopling of his
new city, Agane, with the conquered nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>His longest and greatest campaign was a
later invasion of Syria at which he was absent
from his kingdom for three years. At this
time he penetrated to the “Sea of the setting
Sun”—the Mediterranean—conquering all the
countries through which he passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the rocky cliffs of the Asian shore he left
inscriptions recording his triumphs, and memorial
statues of him were erected in various
places. It is possible that he crossed to Cyprus
where relics of him, and of his son, Naram-Sin,
have been found.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seems to have had ambitions of universal
empire, and it is stated that after his return
from this expedition, “he appointed that all
places should form a single kingdom.” Of
this he says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Forty-five years the kingdom I have ruled,
and the black Accadian race I have governed.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'>[105]</span>“In multitude of bronze chariots I rode
over rugged lands.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Three times to the coast of the Persian sea
I advanced.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The countries of the Sea of the setting Sun
I crossed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the third year at the setting Sun my
hand conquered.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Under one command I caused them to be
only fixed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naram-Sin—the beloved of Sin, the Moon
God—continued the military advances of his
father. The records remaining state that he
invaded Egypt and held in possession for a
time Maganna, the land of Magan, the region
of the turquoise and copper mines and of the
famous diorite.</p>

<p class='c000'>A vase discovered at Babylon and since lost
in the Tigris, has on it the inscription:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Naram-Sin, King of the Four Races, Conqueror of Apirak and Magan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A second alabaster vase was found by M. de
Sarazec in the ruins of Tel-Loh, having inscribed
on it the words:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Naram-Sin, King of the Four Regions,”
or king of the north, south, east and west.</p>

<p class='c000'>This vase was imbedded in the masonry,
evidently later restorations of the earlier buildings
of Gudea.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cylinder found by General Cesnola, at
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'>[106]</span>Cyprus has on it an inscription declaring its
owner as a worshipper of Naram-Sin, who it
seems had been deified by his subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first volume of Babylonian inscriptions
found at Nippur, Prof. Hilfrecht records
six inscriptions of Sargon, two brick stamps
of baked clay, fragments of many vases and
three door sockets, most of these temple offerings
to Bel—Mul-lil, of Nippur. The door
sockets contain the longest inscriptions of Sargon
thus far known.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many inscriptions of Naram-Sin
in the Nippur remains, and yet more now in
course of translation. These refer again to the
restoration by these kings of the temple of Bel
and their dominion over the whole of South
Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>As these explorations are yet in progress, it
is too early to indicate the farther evidences
of these early rulers of Babylonia remaining
at Nippur.</p>

<p class='c000'>The various localities in which these relics
have been found indicate the extensive sway
of these monarchs. They suggest also the
period when certain gods of Chaldea were
adopted by the various nations and people conquered
by Sargon or Naram-Sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sinai, the mountain of Sin, the Moon God,
may be a reminiscence of the invasion of Arabia
by Naram-Sin directed by this divinity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'>[107]</span>Mount Nebo, the mountain upon which
Moses died, received its name from the Chaldean
Nebo, the god of science and literature,
the god of wisdom and prophesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Istar, the evening star, the Chaldean Venus,
the goddess of love and fertility, became the
Atthar of southern Arabia, is identical with
the goddess Hathor, of Egyptian mythology,
and was worshipped by the Canaanites as Ashtaroth,
and finally by the Greeks as Astarte.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against this background of history and tradition,
of civilization so remote, a notable figure
appears about fifteen hundred and forty
years later than the great Sharrukin, or 2260
B. C., in whom the most sacred traditions of
later civilizations were to have their rise.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was Abraham, or Abu-ramu, “the exalted
father” with whom the history of the people
of Israel begins. A Semite, and a native
of Ur, his historical position is an important
landmark in the story of letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of special significance in this connection is
this early contact of Abraham and his family
with the land and people of Chaldea;—the
lingering survivals of Accadian speech and
traditions in Hebrew language and literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, when Abraham left Chaldea to found
a great nation in another land, writing and
literature could not have been unknown to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The constant use of cuneiform signs in architectural
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'>[108]</span>structures, in business forms and
in every department of social and industrial
life and the ever present schools for scribes in
all the great cities of Mesopotamia made this
impossible. The art of writing was no new
thing to this young Semite prince. It was an
art even then hoary with age.</p>

<p class='c000'>With all to whom Abraham is a historic personality,
the story of his life and times as recorded
in the biblical narrative, is illuminated
as never before in the testimony of these cuneiform
documents from old Chaldea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The biblical narrative does not touch upon
the causes which led Abraham away from the
land of his nativity. Jewish and Arabian traditions,
however, state (and there may be a
grain of truth in these traditions), that this
was the result of the revolt of Abraham against
the idols of Ur, and his refusal to acknowledge
them as divine; that this brought upon him
and his father’s family a storm of persecution
from the priests and people which ended in
their banishment from Ur, and their departure
for a distant country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The references in the scripture narrative to
Terah, the father of Abraham, as an idolator,
and the Arabian tradition as a sculptor or maker
of idols, is significant in these connections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The destination of this family was Haran,
at that time a Turanian city in northern Mesopotamia,
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'>[109]</span>an important frontier station on the
high road to Syria and Palestine, and the various
roads to the fords of the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word Haran is from the Accadian,
Kharran, “a road,” and was thus named for
its position. It is said to lie in a region of
exceeding fertility and beauty. Its fine, free
air and commanding views make it the delight
of the Bedaween tribes who find here luxuriant
pasturage for innumerable flocks and herds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Previous to the time of Abraham, there seems
to have been at Haran, and in the region round
about, a considerable colony of Semitic people,
as indicated by Assyrian inscriptions. Since
Abraham’s date, “Nahor’s City” and the
“Well of Rebekah,” located near Haran, bear
these ancient names to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The deity of Haran was then the Moon God,
the same deity as worshipped at Ur, always a
favorite divinity with all Semitic people, and
which might have been an influence that drew
Terah there. During the remaining years of
Terah’s life, Abraham remained in this locality,
prospering greatly; but with his father’s
death his long conceived purpose of establishing
himself in Canaan was finally achieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>After Abraham’s arrival in Canaan with his
numerous household, his princely retinue and
his great possessions, we find him again in
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'>[110]</span>contact with certain Babylonian princes who
have invaded Canaan and have obtained sovereignty
in various localities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourteenth chapter of Genesis gives account
of the battle of Abraham with these kings
of Babylonia for the rescue of Lot, his nephew,
in which he put the invaders to flight, establishing
peace and security in the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The names of these kings as given in the
scripture narrative are Chedorlaomer, king of
Elam; Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch,
king of Ellasar, or Larsa, and Tidal, king of
nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>These kings are now identified by Babylonian
records, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, as Kudur-Lagomar,
an Elamite king of that date;
Arioch, king of Ellasar, with Eri-Aku, then
king of Larsa. Amraphel, king of Shinar, is
identified as Hammurabi, or Khammuragas,
and Tidal, king of nations, as Thorgal, king
of Gutium, a region to the north of Elam.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evident correspondence of these kings
with Abraham’s contemporaries, furnish continued
evidence of the political contacts of
Babylonia and Canaan from the earliest times,
and in many ways confirm the historical verities
of the early scripture records.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another document, reflecting new light from
the cuneiform inscriptions, is the last exhortation
of Joshua to Israel assembled at Shechem.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'>[111]</span>In the review he then gives of the history of
his people, he says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the
flood—the Euphrates—in the old time; even
Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
of Nahor, and they served other gods.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And I took your father Abraham from the
other side of the flood and led him throughout
all the land of Canaan. And I brought you
into the land of the Amorites ✴ ✴ and I gave
them into your hand; ✴ ✴ now, therefore,
fear the Lord ✴ ✴ and serve him in sincerity
and truth and put away the gods which your
fathers served on the other side of the flood and
in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole discourse bears internal evidence
of a written report, fresh from the voice of the
speaker. We now know that the functions of
the scribe were as constantly employed as the
modern reporter through all Babylonia and
Assyria as well as Egypt at these early dates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom
of the Egyptians, evidently had no lack of
scribes among the Israelites. The Tel-el-Amarna
tablets give evidence of the general practice
of the art of writing through all Canaan
before the days of Moses and Joshua.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus little need to refer to the period
of the Babylonian captivity for the appearance
of Accadian and Aramean words in early
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'>[112]</span>Hebrew history, or for the correspondences of
Chaldean legends with scripture records.</p>

<p class='c000'>The origin of the documents which in Ezra’s
time were collected and re-written in new form,
were historical remnants surviving from the
earlier periods to which they are assigned in
history and tradition.</p>

THE Semitic Assyrians and the Semitic
people of other portions of Mesopotamia,
had adopted the cuneiform
script and the Turanian syllabary as early as
the days of Sargon. From this time onward,
and until the days of Assyrian and Babylonian
supremacy, these signs were the common medium
of literary intercourse among the nations
of western Asia and expressed various languages
and dialects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous documents recently found in
Egypt, known as the “Tel-el-Amarna” letters,
indicate the extensive use of cuneiform
writing in the fifteenth century before Christ,
or about seven hundred and twenty years after
Abraham.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of the discovery of these documents
is still another among the many romances
which archæology so constantly and so unexpectedly
presents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The site of the modern Arab village, Tel-el-Amarna,
is about one hundred and ninety
miles south of Cairo, on the eastern bank of
the river Nile.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'>[114]</span>The mountain chain which here follows the
course of the river, recedes at this point in the
form of a bay, and upon the sandy plain thus
partially enclosed, many interesting remains
appear, indicating the site of an ancient city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tombs on the hillside have long been of
special interest to Egyptologists.</p>

<p class='c000'>This city was known to have been the royal
residence, and for a time the capital of Egypt,
under Amenophis IV, the ninth king of the
eighteenth dynasty. This king, son of Amenophis
III and Queen Teie, a princess of Mitanni,
was through several generations of maternal
descent more Asiatic than Egyptian.</p>

<p class='c000'>The royal house of Mitanni—the Aram-Nahairam
of the Hebrews—had given in marriage
several successive princesses to the kings of
Egypt. Tothmes III, during his wars of conquest
in western Asia, had obtained a princess
of Mitanni in marriage, and this alliance was
further cemented by the Egyptian kings, his
successors, to the period of Amenophis III, the
father of Khu n Aten, Amenophis IV.</p>

<p class='c000'>These frequent alliances had brought about
an inclination for the gods of the Mesopotamian
mothers, and after while this younger
son of the royal house of Egypt, openly professed
his adoption of the worship of Aten, the
supreme Baal of the Semitic people of Asia,
and attempted to substitute this for the worship
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'>[115]</span>of Amon, the god of Thebes. He erased the
name of the Egyptian god from the monuments
and temples wherever found. This so aroused
the indignation of the powerful priesthood devoted
to the worship of Amon, that Amenophis
found it necessary to leave for a time the
capital of his kingdom at Thebes and to found
another elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was established on the site of the modern
Tel-el-Armana. The king took to himself
a new title, Khu n Aten, “The Splendor of
the Sun’s Disc,” by which name also he designated
his new city. His reign after this
seems to have been of short duration. After
him, two or three princes of his house succeeded
him, but with him Egyptian supremacy
in western Asia was at an end and the subject
provinces of Syria and Palestine passed out of
Egyptian hands and rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mummy of this monarch has recently
been found in a royal sepulcher of the kings of
Thebes with those of other kings of this ancient
dynasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The revolt against the heretical king was
extensive and Egypt was distracted with civil
wars. The adherents of the ancient religions
soon brought the worship of the new heresy
to an end, and Rameses, first king of the nineteenth
dynasty, restored the worship of Amon
and the ancient gods of Egypt, with all power
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'>[116]</span>and dignity and brought with him a return of
peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the aversion of the Egyptian people
for the capital of the heretic king, that,
although his city was built almost entirely of
sun-dried bricks, it has suffered less from the
ravages of time than the more solidly constructed
cities of Thebes and Memphis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prisse D’Avennes, who gives a description
of the site of Khu n Aten, says that the principal
streets of the city are distinct and the
greater buildings can in part be traced. And
again, that some of the buildings of sun-burnt
brick are the best preserved and most ancient
dwellings in the valley of the Nile.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1887 some clay tablets of peculiar and
foreign character were found in these ruins in
company with Egyptian relics. These tablets
resembled for the most part small pillows of
clay and they were inscribed with cuneiform
characters. With them were found a few larger
tablets, some small cylinders also inscribed
in cuneiform, and seals and other relics
with hieroglyphic inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ruins where they were found were at
first supposed to have been the remains of the
royal residence, but further examination indicates
this structure as the depository of the
royal archives, the abode of the king’s scribe
and custodian of documents. It was near the
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'>[117]</span>palace though not of it. A portion of these
documents were placed in the museum at Cairo,
some were obtained for the British Museum,
and the remainder by the Royal Museum of
Berlin. They include in all three hundred
letters from kings of Babylonia, Assyria, Mesopotamia
and northern Syria, and from subject
princes and governors in Palestine and throughout
Canaan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although in cuneiform script, these characters
varied with the locality from whence they
came. The indications are that this system of
writing had been long in use throughout western
Asia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The language chiefly used in these documents
was the Semitic Babylonian, in the syllabary
of the older Turanian form. In one or two
cases the writer uses the Babylonian script to
express his native language, the speech of the
locality from whence the letter was sent, but
these instances are rare.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one letter from Tushratta, or Dusratta,
king of Mitanni, the first seven lines are in
Assyrian, but after this the remaining five
hundred and five lines are in his native language,
the speech of Mitanni, a language as
yet unknown, having never been translated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The meanings of a few words have been determined
by Dr. Sayce and other scholars and
the indications are that the language was a
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'>[118]</span>Mongol dialect, akin to the Accadian. The
similarity of some words to those used by the
Hittite prince, Tarkondara, who also writes
about this time to Amenophis III, indicates
this to be of the same family of speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writing of this document is syllabic; and
in the older cuneiform, with very few determinatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some later explorations at Tel-el-Amarna
Mr. Petrie came upon some fragments of other
tablets in cuneiform which proved to be dictionaries.
“In one case the dictionary expresses
Semitic Babylonian and Sumerian, and
as the Sumerian words are written phonetically
as well as ideographically, it would appear that
Sumerian must have been still a living language.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On one of these later found tablets, Babylonian
words are given to explain words of two
other languages, one of which Mr. Boscawen
thinks to be old Egyptian. If this is the case
it is the only instance in the Tel-el-Amarna
collections where this appears. In no other
portion of this correspondence is the language
of Egypt used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Throughout the vast region represented by
these letters, including various races and forms
of speech, from the upper Euphrates to Babylonia;
from northern Syria to southern Palestine;
everywhere, the Babylonian language and
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'>[119]</span>Babylonian script were the common medium
of literary intercourse in this correspondence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that many of these letters seem to
have been individual productions and not the
work of special schools of scribes indicates the
widespread influence of Babylonian culture,
and the opportunities for education existing
throughout the Orient in the century before
the Exodus.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are evidences that the schools and libraries
of the ancient cities of Mesopotamia
had their counterparts in the cities of southern
Palestine; as for instance Kirgath-Seper, “The
City of Books,” to which we find later reference
as Kirgath-Sanneh, “The City of Instruction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The glimpses afforded of social and political
conditions in various localities at the period
of this correspondence are of historical importance,
furnishing data and verifying documents
found elsewhere, of the same persons
and events.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have in the Tel-el-Amarna collection,
letters from Burraburyash and his father, kings
of Kardungyash or Babylon, to Amenophis III
of Egypt, in which reference is made to the
Egyptian princess, sister of Amenophis, wife
of the king of Babylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burraburyash also wants gold, “much gold”
from the Egyptian king, for the building of
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'>[120]</span>his temple, and complains that this does not
come to him in sufficient quantities.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one letter from the king of Assyria
and many letters from Tushratta, or Dusratta,
king of Mitanni. These latter refer chiefly to
the princesses of Mitanni, wives of the Egyptian
kings, Queen Teie, mother of Amenophis
IV, and the princess Kirghipa, whose magnificent
dowry occupies a great portion of some
of the largest tablets in the collection. The
lists include horses and a chariot covered with
gold, ornaments of silver and gold of finest
Babylonian workmanship, decorated with precious
stones and rich garments of variegated
stuffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the death of Amenophis III, this princess
became the wife of Amenophis IV, his son,
who thus continued his alliance with the powerful
and wealthy Tushratta, king of Mitanni.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the most interesting letters in the
collection are from Syria and Palestine, from
the native princes and governors of cities, at
this time subject to the Egyptian kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondence of Ebed-tob, priest king
and governor of Jerusalem, is of special interest.
Jerusalem was at this time a city of the
Amorites, a Semitic people of Palestine and its
name in these documents is Uru-Salim, signifying
“The City of the god Salim,” or the
“God of Peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'>[121]</span>Ebed-tob impresses the fact upon his royal
correspondent that though subject to the Egyptian
king, he is king of Uru-Salim by an oracle
of the god of Salim. He was thus priest king
of the city by divine appointment and not by
heredity. This statement suggests that earlier
king of Jerusalem, Melchizedek, who, as king
of Salem and priest of the “Most High God,”
comes forth with bread and wine and blessings
for Abraham, the Deliverer of the country
from its foes; the Restorer of Peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Assyrian form, Sar Salim, “King of
Salem,” is identical with the Hebrew Sar Shalom,
“Prince of Peace.” This again illustrates
the application by Isaiah of the title of
“Prince of Peace” to that later “Prince of
the House of David,” who, in a higher spiritual
sense than his great prototype, Melchizedek,
was yet to be to all nations and people
“King of Salem” and “Prince of Peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The most remarkable event in the history of
archæology has its connections with the Tel-el-Amarna
discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the letters in this collection addressed
to Amenophis IV, from the governors of
cities in southern Palestine, are those from the
governor of Lachish. This dignitary was
named Zimrida and his dispatches to the king
of Egypt were chiefly upon the political conditions
of his province, its dangers from approaching
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'>[122]</span>foes and the necessity of relief from
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems that Zimrida was in greater danger
from foes within than without, for in one of
the later letters from Ebed-tob, he alludes to
the murder of Zimrida by servants of the Egyptian
king.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discovery of these cuneiform tablets from
southern Palestine had strengthened the growing
convictions of Prof. Sayce that lying beneath
many of the <i>tels</i> or mounds that marked
the sites of ancient cities throughout southern
Palestine, other similar treasures were buried.
The name Kirgath Sepher, “Book Town,”
was strongly suggestive, and acting upon these
impressions he urged the Palestine Exploration
Fund to undertake explorations in this
region.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tel-el-Amarna letters were discovered
in 1887. It was not, however, until 1890 that
the officers of the Palestine Exploration Fund
were able to obtain the necessary permission
from the Turkish government, or to secure
the services of the distinguished explorer, Dr.
Petrie, for the work. This gentleman began
excavations in the month of April of that year.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some days of examination of various
<i>tels</i> in this region for the site of Lachish, he
decided to commence work at the <i>tel</i> or mound
Tel-el-Hesy, so called from the river Hesy
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'>[123]</span>which flows by the hill on which the mound
is located. It is about seventeen miles to the
east of Gaza. The natural eminence upon
which it is situated rises to a height of forty
feet above the valley. Above this the mound
consists of a succession of town levels, the one
above the other, sixty feet higher, from which
a commanding view of the region is obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately for the explorer, the turbulent
stream flowing over these declivities has cut
this <i>tel</i> on the eastern side from top to bottom,
leaving the whole face exposed and revealing
distinctly the various city levels of the several
periods of occupation. The commanding position
of the site, the fine springs of water,
gushing from the hillsides, and the rapid
stream, affording an abundance of fresh, sweet
water, the locality agreeing in so many particulars
with the site of ancient Lachish, the evidences
also in the hillside of the existence at
various periods of ancient important cities,
justified his convictions which subsequent discoveries
verified.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some months of excavation, Dr. Petrie
was obliged to discontinue his work here for
engagements elsewhere, leaving further explorations
in the hands of Mr. Bliss.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a>The result of Dr. Petrie’s labors had been
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'>[124]</span>to establish known facts in the history of ancient
Lachish. The lowest and earliest town
must have been of great strength and importance.
The remains of the walls are twenty-eight
feet and eight inches in thickness, of
bricks unburnt, with two successive patchings
of rebuilding occupying thirty-nine of the sixty
feet in the height of the mound. At this level
the fragments of pottery were distinct and
peculiar, very different from the relics of the
cities above and which, from relics elsewhere
obtained, give the period of their use and manufacture
at 1500 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next level indicated a barbaric invasion
when rude huts were piled up, to fall soon
after into ruin. After this comes successive
strata of Jewish cities until about 400 B. C.,
since which time Lachish passed out of history
and no later relics are found.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these things Dr. Petrie says: “The
Amorite pottery extends from 1500 B. C., to
1000 B. C. Phœnician and Cypriote begins
about 1000 and goes to 700 B. C. Greek influence
then begins and continues to the top
of the town.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon leaving, he pointed out to Dr. Bliss
the indications that the lower portions of the
<i>tel</i> would bring to light the ruins of a city destroyed
by the invading Israelites.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the early relics found by Mr. Bliss,
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'>[125]</span>when the lower stratum of cities was more
thoroughly explored, were a number of Egyptian
beads and scarabs of the eighteenth Egyptian
dynasty, on one of which the name of
Queen Teie, wife of Amenophis III and mother
of Amenophis IV, appears.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also a number of seal cylinders,
some of Egyptian and some of Babylonian
manufacture, of the same period or earlier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most wonderful discovery, however,
was to come, verifying the predictions of Prof.
Sayce and the judgment of Dr. Petrie, but in
a way to astonish even these eminent scholars
to whom all things seem possible. This was
the discovery of a clay tablet inscribed in cuneiform
characters similar in size, form and
other peculiarities, to the letters from Lachish
in the Tel-el-Amarna documents.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is written in the Babylonian language and
with the Babylonian syllabary, and what is
still more astonishing, the name of Zimrida
appears upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It proves to be a letter addressed to an Egyptian
officer, received at Lachish about the time
Zimrida’s letter was sent to the king of Egypt.
In this the name of Zimrida, who, according
to the Tel-el-Amarna dispatches was governor
of Lachish, is twice mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here in Canaan, deep beneath the remains
of many cities, and there upon the banks of the
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'>[126]</span>Nile, these two fragments of a correspondence
have lain through many centuries, waiting the
time when this long forgotten story might be
read and explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lachish letter was claimed at once by
the Turkish government, and those who have
attempted its translation have been obliged to
do this from squeezes or impressions of the original
document, which in some cases are imperfect,
as some of the characters are partly
obliterated or on the edges of the tablet. Quite
enough, however, is apparent to identify the
date and significance of the documents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tel-el-Amarna documents also indicate
in a way the date of the Exodus. They at least
prove, of the periods sometimes assigned, when
this could not have happened, and to point to
the probabilities when it did.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the letters from southern Canaan we have
a distinct view of Palestine before its occupation
by the Children of Israel. They had not
taken possession of Lachish, nor had they entered
Jerusalem. At this time Palestine and
all Syria were under Egyptian domination.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governors of many of the cities were
often times native Egyptians, and Egyptian
garrisons were stationed at all important points
for their protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the time of Thotmes III, of the eighteenth
dynasty, to the close of the reign of
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'>[127]</span>Amenophis IV, this state of affairs had continued
and during this period no Egyptian king
corresponds to the Pharaoh of the Oppression.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the invasion of Canaan by the
Israelites and their occupation of its cities, the
domination of Egypt had ceased. This did
not occur until the close of the eighteenth dynasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the nineteenth dynasty came in, with
Rameses I, a new order of things arose. The
reaction against the heresies of Amenophis extended
to all Asiatic influences, and the Semitic
people throughout the realm found in Rameses
and his immediate successors the Pharaohs
who “knew not Joseph.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, in certain of these letters from southern
Palestine, there are references to the
“Khabiri” who were threatening these cities,
and in the Khabiri some scholars read the
word Hebrews and their approaching invasion
of Palestine.</p>

<p class='c000'>This would place these letters at the close of
the “Wandering in the Wilderness,” instead of
earlier. Against this view is urged that the
political conditions of Canaan at the time of
this correspondence do not agree with those
of the Israelitish invasion of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word Khabiri signifies “confederates.”
They are probably the people of Hebron, one
of the old Amorite cities, and confederated
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'>[128]</span>against the alien Egyptian authorities, with
their stronghold at Hebron.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the letters of Ebed-tob to the king of
Egypt, he complains of certain officials in the
neighboring cities who are conspiring with the
Khabiri, the most dangerous foe to the constituted
authorities in that part of Palestine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preservation of these documents among
the archives of the Egyptian king show that
these appeals were received. The evidences
are that they were sent to Amenophis IV near
the close of his reign. Then civil war, which
continued for some time after his death, and
during the reign of his immediate successors,
made it necessary to recall the Egyptian troops
abroad, and the strongholds of Egyptian rule
in Asia soon surrendered to native and foreign
claimants of Syria and Canaan.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is scarcely possible, in so brief a sketch,
to give an estimate of things indicated, or the
historical importance of these documents. The
most striking of the things indicated is the
large range presented of Babylonian influence
and culture.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not more noticeable in the countries
bordering upon the Euphrates valley than it is
throughout the region lying along the eastern
coast of the Mediterranean and the western
slopes of Amanus, from northern Syria to the
valley of the Nile.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'>[129]</span>From Tyre and Sidon, Beyrut and Joppa,
Gaza and Askalon, Jerusalem, Lachish and
other ancient cities of Syria, Palestine and Canaan,
letters were addressed to the king of
Egypt; not in the language of Egypt, nor yet
of Syria or Canaan, but in the language and
script of Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is hardly what might have been expected.
We might have expected, for instance,
the speech of the Semitic people of Syria or
Canaan—this older Hebrew—to have assumed
Hebraic forms; that older Phœnician script for
which scholars are so earnestly searching. Or
we might reasonably have supposed that documents
from this region and at this time would
have been expressed in the written forms of
the hieroglyphic system of Egypt; but this
was not the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem of the use at this date of the
script and language of Babylonia by the Semitic
people of Syria and Canaan, must be referred
to the extensive influence of Babylonian
culture and power, which had been more or
less dominant in Canaan from the period of
Sargon I.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this, Prof. Sayce says:</p>
<p class='c017'>“So long had this system of writing been
adopted in western Asia, and so long had it
had its home there, that each district and nationality
had time to form its peculiar hand.
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'>[130]</span>We can tell at a glance by merely looking at
the forms assumed, whether a particular document
came from the south of Palestine, from
Phœnicia or from northern Syria.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the prevalence of its use throughout
the vast region represented by these documents,
from the Persian Gulf to the mountains
of Armenia, from beyond the Tigris to
the Mediterranean Sea and from northern Syria
to Arabia, implies the centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>It indicates that what our alphabetic system
is to modern civilizations the Babylonian cuneiform
was to the civilizations of western Asia
in the century preceding the Exodus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another influence for the persistency and
spread of the cuneiform writing, was due to
the great libraries established in various cities,
to which the people had access. These had
existed from the earliest times in Babylonia,
and undoubtedly spread with the spread of
Babylonian influence and culture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of legendary libraries in Chaldea, Berosus
tells of the antediluvian city Pantabibla, town
of Books, and Sippara, also City of the Sun,
where Xisthurus, the Chaldean Noah, buried
his books before the Deluge, and from whence
they were disentombed after the subsidence
of the waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of actual collections, literary remains from
the library of Erech, the most ancient of Chaldean
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'>[131]</span>cities, give evidence of the antiquity of
these institutions, as also others from Cutha,
Larsa and various localities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The library of Larsa, or Senkereh, was famous
for its mathematical works, and here students
of that science came from all parts of the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some tablets from this library are now in the
British Museum, among which are tables of
squares, and there are traces of a Chaldean
Euclid, with geometrical figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Assyria, the great libraries established in
various cities were at the expense of the libraries
of Babylonia. They were founded by the
kings of Assyria who became for the time
masters of Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the enrichment of Assyria, the Babylonian
libraries were despoiled of many treasures
of which such books were selected and removed
as would add to the glory of Assyria.</p>

<p class='c000'>The books of the Assyrian libraries established
in various cities consisted either of works
from the older libraries or were copies of books
left in their original homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ancient of the Assyrian libraries
of which we have account, after that of the
great Sargon, of Agane, was that of Calah.
This city was founded by Shalmaneser, about
1300 B. C., but later on was laid waste during
some invasions of Assyria. It was afterwards
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'>[132]</span>rebuilt by Assur-natsi-pal, king of Assyria,
885 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this restoration of Calah, he founded the
celebrated library in which, with other literature,
was deposited the great work on astronomy,
entitled the “Observations of Bel.” This
work was first composed for the library of
Sargon at Agane, and throughout Assyrian
and Babylonian history had a wide reputation.
It was translated in later times into Greek by
Berosus, the Chaldean historian, from many
copies of the work made for the great library
of Assur-bani-pal, at Kouyunjik. Many fragments
of these copies are now in the British
Museum, but the table of contents which remains
gives a good conception of the subjects
treated in the original work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assur-bani-pal says of the founding of his
royal library, that inspired by “Nebo, the
prophet god of Literature,” and “his wife,
Tasmit, the Bearer,” he had regard to the engraved
characters of which, as much as was
suitable on tablets, he had written and explained
and placed in his library for the inspection
of his subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this library, strangers from all countries
were also admitted, and for their assistance in
the study of literature and the translation of
these documents, syllabaries were prepared in
which the cuneiform characters were classified
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'>[133]</span>and arranged. With these were the phrase
books and dictionaries presenting the ancient
Accadian form of the word with its Assyrian
equivalent.</p>

<p class='c000'>By these means the modern student of cuneiform
has been able to translate this long
forgotten language as readily as the student of
the period of Assur-bani-pal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like testimony from other localities is coming
to light, of the literary activity which prevailed
for long centuries—we may say milleniums—throughout
the vast region affected by
Babylonian influence. There were books and
libraries everywhere, and those who could read
and write them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The imperishable nature of these baked clay
records is yet to furnish other and greater surprises.
Beneath the mounds which dot the
plains and valleys of Mesopotamia, Syria and
Palestine, the treasures of many ancient libraries
undoubtedly still await the spade of the
explorer.</p>

THROUGHOUT the whole history of
cuneiform writing, with the Babylonians
and Assyrians it continued a
syllabic system. There was no development
with them of alphabetic characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first evidences we have as yet of such
development through this cuneiform was at the
time when the Medes, an Aryan people related
to the Persians, received from the primitive or
earlier inhabitants of Media their system of
writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Proto-Medic tribes were a Turanian
people of Ural-Altaic stock speaking an agglutinative
language. Their system of writing
was the cuneiform, and had been a development
from the Semitic Babylonian script.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the adaptations of this to the requirements
of an agglutinative speech a process of
simplifying had occurred quite similar to that
which the Japanese present upon the transmission
to them of the graphic system of the
Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Semitic Babylonian system which was
originally adopted from the cuneiform of a
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'>[135]</span>Turanian people, had developed a complicated
and cumbrous method of writing, including
over five hundred signs. This had arisen in
the attempts to adapt a syllabary and characters
expressing an agglutinative speech to the
uses of a Semitic language.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was from this that the Persian cuneiform
was derived, and in the further simplicity
which appeared in the transmission of this to
an Aryan people, and its applications to an
Aryan speech, that we find a development towards
alphabetism.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the adoption of the Proto-Medic cuneiform
by the Medes and Persians, many of the
syllabic signs, instead of representing syllables
came on the acrologic principle to be used as
alphabetic characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>As certain of these signs retained a syllabic
character, the Persian cuneiform was never a
pure alphabet, though far on the way to this
as early as the period of the Achæmenian
kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Taylor says of this:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The idea of alphabetism may not improbably
have been suggested to the Persians by
their acquaintance with the Phœnician alphabet,
which as early as the eighth century B. C.
was used in the valley of the Euphrates concurrently
with cuneiform writing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of the Persepolitan and Behistun
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'>[136]</span>inscriptions, and during the two previous centuries,
the Aramean alphabet, daughter of the
Phœnician, had been a commercial script of
the Semitic people of northern Mesopotamia
and Syria.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of Darius it was used at the
courts of the Assyrian kings in official records,
and later on at Babylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, upon the decline of the Assyrian and
Babylonian empires, and with these the decadence
of the cuneiform, this was superseded
by the Aramean alphabet. Of this, however,
later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever influences the alphabet of Aram
may have had in suggesting the idea of alphabetism
to the originators of the Persian cuneiform,
the result was original and distinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this Persian cuneiform, which has furnished
the key to the decipherment of all cuneiform,
the fullest vocabulary has been found
in the Behistun inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rock on which these are engraved is
situated near the western frontier of Persia on
the direct route from Babylon to Ecbatana.
It rises an isolated mountain from the plain to
a height of seventeen hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one side is a sheer wall of precipitous
rock. At its base is a copious fountain. On
one of the great highways of travel, its isolated
position and peculiar features have made this
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'>[137]</span>a notable landmark throughout the ages. At
the northern extremity of this escarpment, in
a recess to the right, are the famous inscriptions
of Darius, son of Hystapes. To make
these inaccessible to foreign invaders or domestic
foes, they were placed about three hundred
feet above the base of the rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Henry Rawlinson, who first deciphered
these inscriptions, attempted the work by the
aid of powerful field glasses, but later succeeded
in obtaining a closer inspection by means
of ropes let down from the cliffs at great expense
and at the risk of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wonder is, how the engravers could have
done the work. The rock was beautifully polished
before inscribed, and in some places
where there were inequalities of surface, pieces
of the rock were fitted in and fastened with
molten lead. This was done with such delicacy
that only by close and careful scrutiny can it
be detected.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the engraving had been completed, a
fine coat of silicious varnish was laid over, to
give clearness of outline to each letter, and to
protect the surface against the action of the
elements.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the inscriptions, Sir Henry Rawlinson
says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“For beauty of execution, for uniformity
and correctness, they are unequalled.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'>[138]</span>The purpose of King Darius in these memorials
was to set forth to his subjects his hereditary
right to the throne of Persia, and the
glories of his reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Darieiros,” he says, “the great king,
the king of kings, the king of Persia, the king
of nations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, after giving the record of his
genealogy back to Achæmenes, the first of his
line, he says: “There are eight of my race
who have been kings before me; I am the
ninth. In a double line we have been kings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions consist of a thousand lines
in three columns and in three languages; an
Aryan, a Turanian and a Semitic speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first column, addressed to the Persian
people of his realm, was written in the Persian
cuneiform, with thirty-six alphabetic signs
and but four ideograms. The second was to
the Proto-Medic, or as now called, Scythic inhabitants
of the kingdom, and was written in
the Turanian cuneiform, with ninety-six pure
syllabic signs, accompanied by seven surviving
ideograms. The third version, to the Assyrian
or Semitic subjects of the Persian king,
was inscribed in the Semitic Babylonian cuneiform,
including five hundred characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the discovery by Grotefend of the key
to the decipherment of the Persian cuneiform,
Sir Henry Rawlinson, an English military officer
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'>[139]</span>in the service of the East India Company,
while on duty in Persia, undertook the study
of cuneiform characters.</p>

<p class='c000'>This he attempted independently, with no
one to aid him, as at this time he was not acquainted
with the discoveries of Grotefend, or
the methods pursued by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greater simplicity of the Persian versions
in the trilingual inscriptions, suggested less
difficulties to overcome and led him to pursue
the same lines by which Grotefend had previously
obtained success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Henry Rawlinson was able to carry forward
the decipherment of cuneiform much
farther than Grotefend, owing partly to the
better knowledge of the ancient languages of
Persia attained at this time, and partly to the
fact that he had escaped the mistakes which
obstructed Grotefend in his later decipherments
of cuneiform.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that Grotefend discovered
the true values of twelve of the forty-eight
letters of the Persian alphabet. Further
than this he did not go. He made the mistake
of supposing all the vowel sounds were expressed
in this system, which is not the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>With some of the consonants, the vowel
sound is inherent and is not written with an
independent sign. This mistake prevented his
further progress; but his success had pointed
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'>[140]</span>the way, and a host of eager and able scholars
at once entered this new field of oriental philology.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most promising direction seemed to be
the Zend, the so called language in which the
sacred books of the Parsees was written. Of
this, but one or two fragments known to be
genuine were at this time to be found in the
libraries of Europe; one in the Bodleian Library,
chained to the wall, and here and there
a few stray leaves of Zend manuscript in other
collections.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1771 a work had been deposited
by its author, Anquetil Duperron, which he
claimed to be a translation from the original
Zend-Avesta, with copy of the texts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work had been pronounced a forgery by
certain distinguished scholars; but the well
known scholarship of its author held the judgments
of other learned philologists in abeyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of this effort is of romantic interest.
While a youth, preparing for priesthood
in the seminaries of Paris, he became so absorbed
in the study of language, that he gave
himself entirely to these pursuits, abandoning
his intentions of the study of theology.</p>

<p class='c000'>While thus engaged, some stray leaves of a
Zend manuscript came into his hands, which
so filled his mind with a desire to read the language
of the Parsees that he determined to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'>[141]</span>At this time the conflicting interests of the
English and French in India reached a crisis.
Enlisting as a private soldier in the French
army, he was about to sail for India when the
officers of the institute to which he was attached,
affected by his zeal for learning, obtained
from the Minister of War a free passage for
him to Pondicherry, with a seat during the
voyage at the captain’s table and a salary to be
paid him on his arrival in India while he carried
on his studies.</p>

<p class='c000'>After reaching Pondicherry, he began the
study of Sanscrit and Arabic, and later on,
through great hardship, finally reached Surat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he obtained the confidence of certain
Parsee priests, who permitted him access to
their sacred books, and through whose assistance
he acquired sufficient knowledge of the
language in which they were written, to enable
him to translate the Zend-Avesta.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to Paris in 1762, with over a
hundred precious manuscripts, he obtained a
small post in the royal library, where he spent
the next nine years in the preparation of his
copies of the original texts of the Zend-Avesta,
translating these for publication. In 1771 the
work was completed and he had the satisfaction
of placing in the Royal Library of Paris
the first authentic version of the Zend-Avesta
and the first translation that had ever appeared
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'>[142]</span>in any European language. As before stated,
many scholars of the time were not prepared
for the work, denying its authenticity and proclaiming
it an audacious forgery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under this cloud, the intrepid author of this
work, conscious of the importance of his contribution
to learning, undaunted by the fate
which so long delayed the just recognition of
his labors, passed the remainder of his days in
cheerful resignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lived to congratulate Grotefend upon his
achievements in the decipherment of cuneiform
and died shortly after, in 1808, at the advanced
age of seventy-seven.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twenty years later, the honors due his name
came through the researches of the illustrious
scholars, Rask and Burnouf, who proved this
great work of Anquetil Duperron to be a genuine
if not correct translation of the Zend-Avesta,
as obtained through the sacred books
of the Parsees.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was by a study of this translation that the
key to the ancient Persian language was obtained
and has since served an important use
in the study of Zend<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> philology.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding its value, this translation
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'>[143]</span>of the Zend-Avesta was by no means perfect.
The faulty teachings of the Parsee priests led
the author into occasional errors which obstructed
the progress of later scholars who depended
too closely upon it for results. Little
by little, however, from the work of Sir Henry
Rawlinson on the Behistun inscriptions, thro’
the researches of Burnouf in the original Zend
manuscripts; again from testimony furnished
by other distinguished scholars, from coins
and other inscriptions, and still again by a
comparative study of Sanscrit, modern Persian
and Arabic, all the letters of the old Persian
cuneiform have been obtained, until now it is
as easily and distinctly read as Greek or Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible, within these limits, to follow
the steps by which these important results
were obtained. The methods employed in
such researches are often only intelligible to
philologists themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this special study, the epigraphic materials
examined included not only cuneiform
signs, but characters representing the fully
developed alphabets of later periods, alphabets
which had superseded the cuneiform as systems
of writing, though expressing the ancient
speech of Persia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ancient copies of the Zend-Avesta
are only to be found in Pehlivi characters, a
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'>[144]</span>Persian alphabetic system of the Sassanian period,
dating from the 3d century A. D.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pehlivi alphabets are direct descendants
of the Aramean alphabet, a daughter of the
older Phœnician, which had developed in the
highlands of Aram, or Upper Mesopotamia,
before the Achamenian period in Persia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Aramean language originally expressed
by these characters, was at this time one of the
most widely spoken of the Semitic dialects, including
the idioms of Syria, Aram and Assyria.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first, as a commercial and literary script,
it came to be extensively used in these and adjacent
countries conjointly with the cuneiform.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the ruins of ancient Nineveh, there are
the remains of what must have been a public
registry office. From this a great number of
terra cotta tablets have been exhumed on which
were inscribed in cuneiform characters records
of legal contracts, including loans of money,
sales of estates and exchanges of other properties.
Many of these tablets were docketed on
the sides or edges in Aramean or Phœnician
letters, by which the subject of each document
could be readily found when piled on the
shelves or in recesses where they were deposited.
Reference in some of these appears from
the time of Tiglath Pileser and Sennacherib,
741 to 681 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other evidences of the extensive use of this
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'>[145]</span>script comes from the later Assyrian kings,
and from Babylonia, until the decline of these
empires, 606 to 538 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the conquests of Babylonia by the Persians,
the Aramean alphabet gradually became
the official script of these regions, finally supplanting
the cuneiform.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of historic documents of this period in the
Aramean script and language was the royal
decree given by Artaxerxes to Ezra for the
rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Aramean was the language spoken at
this time by all the Semitic people of Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that during the whole period
of the Achæmenids a local variety of the Aramean
alphabet was in general use as a cursive
script throughout the empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The perishable materials used for this purpose,
as the bark of trees, skins, papyrus, unbaked
clay, etc., have furnished but few remains
of this form of writing, but that it existed
and was in extensive use at this date,
there are unmistakeable evidences.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not impossible that the works of Zoroaster
may have been so written in the old
Bactrian, as Darius Hystaspes states in the
Median text of the Behistun inscription, that
he has made a book in the Aryan language
which before him did not exist.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The text of the divine law (Avesta)—the
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'>[146]</span>prayer and the translation.” “And then this
ancient book was restored by me in all nations
and the nations followed it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscription of King Asoka, at Kapur
di giri on the northern and western confines
of India, is evidently a survival of this ancient
script.</p>

<p class='c000'>About 500 B. C., the Punjaub was invaded
by the Persians under Darius, and during the
remaining period of the Achæmenian kings
continued a satrapy of Persia. After the conquests
of Alexander, and later, of the decline
of Greek rule, this province was restored to
India. About 251 B. C., Asoka, then king of
India, an earnest and devout believer in Buddha,
ordered certain edicts to be inscribed in
various parts of his empire. These are known
as the fourteen edicts of Asoka.</p>

<p class='c000'>The type of the alphabetic character employed
in the various localities differs. Those
used at Kapur di giri are in a cursive script
from the Aramean, and are often designated
“the Bactrian alphabet,” from its close relationship
to these early Iranian forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this, Dr. Taylor says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Kapur di giri record must be regarded
as an isolated monument of a great Bactrian
alphabet, in which the Zoroasterian books and
an extensive literature were in all probability
conserved.”</p>

FOR monumental purposes, the Persian
cuneiform remained the official script
of the empire conjointly with the Semitic
Scythian cuneiform until the conquest
of Persia by Alexander the Great, about 334
B. C., with which the period of the Achæmenids
closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately following this, the use of the
Greek alphabet appears on coins and inscriptions,
and this continued during the Greek
domination in Persia under the successors of
Alexander.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early Arsacids, the Parthian kings who
brought an end to the rule of the Greeks in
Persia, used also for a time the Greek alphabet
for monumental records and numismatic
legends.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, however, only lasted for a brief period,
for a little later on we find that the Greek letters
have given way to a variety of the Aramean
alphabet, which evidently had been in
general use for a long period as a cursive script.</p>

<p class='c000'>This special variety of the Aramean belongs
to a group of alphabets known as Pehlevi, and
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'>[148]</span>is the oldest of the group. The name Pehlevi
is derived from the word Parthivi, signifying
Parthian. It continued, however, to be applied
not only to the alphabet which first appears
in the early period of Parthian domination
in Persia, but also to the later forms that
developed under the Sassanian kings who succeeded
the Arsacids, or Parthian kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The so called Zend alphabet was the latest
of the Pehlevi, and appears during the later
years of the Sassanian empire. Although the
latest development of the Persian scripts, the
Zend alphabet represents the most ancient form
of Persian speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in these characters that some time
during the Sassanian dynasty the Zend-Avesta,
or sacred books of the Persians, were transcribed
in the ancient speech of their origin,
which have thus been preserved to the present
day by the surviving representatives of this
ancient faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The language expressed in the Gathas, or
hymns, the most archaic portions of the Avesta,
is in the ancient vernacular of eastern Persia;
sometimes called “Old Bactrian,” and is the
most archaic of Iranian dialects.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was apparent when Sanskrit became
known to European scholars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The striking resemblance of the Gathas to
the older Sanskrit of the “Vedic Hymns,” indicated
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'>[149]</span>a close relationship. They seemed,
indeed, like two dialects of the same speech.
In fact, the readiness with which this old Persian
was converted into pure Sanskrit by a few
slight phonetic changes, verified these indications.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the further comparative study of the older
Sanskrit with this older Persian, it was found
that while the Sanskrit may be regarded as the
older brother of the Aryan group, this ancient
Persian is in some respects more archaic.</p>

<p class='c000'>It nevertheless remains that the Sanskrit is
in the main the elder representative of this
family of languages, retaining the characteristic
forms of phonetic structure once common
to the whole family, with their meanings less
changed, than any other branch of the Aryan
group.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is this fact which enabled philologists to
base a science of Aryan philology upon the
Sanskrit. And not only this, but from which
has arisen the science of comparative philology
for all families of languages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may be said of the ethnic affinities
of the Aryans, or their primitive home, this
much has been made evident in the comparative
study of the Vedas and the Avesta; that
there is close kinship here.</p>

<p class='c000'>They tell of a time not so remote in history
as that of older Chaldea or Egypt, when these
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'>[150]</span>Indo-Iranians were one people, with a common
ancestry, inhabiting the same country, speaking
the same language, with the same social
institutions and the same beliefs. They indicate
that the home of these Indo-Iranians,
before their separation, was somewhere near
the head waters of the Oxus, to the north-west
of the Hindu-Kush. That finally there was a
separation of these families, those afterwards
known as the Hindus penetrating these great
mountain passes into the Punjaub, “The land
of the Five Rivers,” in the northwestern part
of India, from whence they spread southward
over this great peninsula.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other branch, the Iranians, remained
for a time north of the Hindu-Kush in Bactria,
which formed later on a part of the ancient
empire of Iran, or Persia, on the northeast.</p>

<p class='c000'>This country was situated in an upper valley
of the Oxus, formed by the Hissar mountains
on the north, and at the south the Hindu-Kush,
extending from the Pamir plateau on the east
to the great desert of Chorasmin on the west,
a fruitful valley, well watered, affording on
the hill slopes of the southern range favorable
pasturage for flocks and herds.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this region the Iranian branch finally
spread westward and southerly throughout the
lands later known as Iran or Persia.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested that the separation of
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'>[151]</span>the Indo-Iranians was the result of religious
differences. The schism indicated in the Rig
Vedas and Avesta seems to have grown out of
the distinction which finally arose between the
signification of the words “Asura” or “Ahura,”
as applied to Deity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The earlier faith of these people seems to
have been a pure nature worship, the sun, the
sky, light, fire, the elements, throughout which
appears also a spiritual conception of a Supreme
Being, Lord of the Sky, the Sun, Creator
of all things, who was known as “Asura,”
or “Ahura.” The most ancient signification
of this word is “The Broad and Enfolding,”
its earliest application as Lord of the Sky, is,
perhaps, a reminiscence of that remote period
in the history of these people when they roamed
the vast steppes of northern central Asia.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spiritual conception which grew from
this, Asura became the Lord of the Broad
Heavens, the God of Light, the Infinite.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word Deva, from the Sanskrit Div, signified
“brilliant,” “shining.” In its spiritual
sense, the “Shining Ones” applied originally
to the ministering spirits, the bright
messengers of Asura. From the word Deva,
we have the word Deus, God; Divus, divine;
dæmons, and other similar forms in various
branches of Aryan speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first, Asura is the most sacred name used
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'>[152]</span>for Deity. Later on, with the increase of gods
in the Hindu pantheon, the term Asura is conferred
as a highest dignity upon the greater
gods, as Asura-Varuna, Asura-Indra.</p>

<p class='c000'>There came a time, however, as appears in
the Vedas, when the Asuras signified a class
of spirits inferior to the Devas, and finally as
spirits opposed to the gods. As the Asuras
were degraded, the Devas were exalted. With
the Iranian branch, there was no such change.
The ancient “Asura,” in Persian, “Ahura,”
remained from first to last their great divine
One; nor throughout the whole history of
Persian mythology are there “any gods before”
him. The word Dævas, with them
came to signify evil spirits—devils.</p>

<p class='c000'>That a schism arose, is apparent; and also
that it was local. “Hard by the believers in
Ahura,” says Zoroaster, “dwell the worshippers
of the dævas.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were the conditions when the great
prophet and sage appears upon the scene, not
as the apostle of a new religion; but as a teacher
of the higher meanings of their ancient faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>As priest and leader of the believers in Ahura
he strikes at once at the root of the dissension.
The worshippers of the dævas are blind followers
of the Evil One, who seek the souls of
men to destroy them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hindus developed into gross polytheism.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'>[153]</span>The Iranians grew into a monotheism, at
once all comprehending and simple; a philosophy
profound, and yet without dogma; a
system of morality noble and true, which has
compelled the admiration of the wise and spiritual
of all ages.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the work of Zara-thustra, or Zoroaster.
He pointed to the existence in all nature
of two principles—Good and Evil. These
were the offices of Ahura-Mazda, the all good,
and Angro-Mainyash, the all evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the regions of Light, the abode of Ahura-Mazda,
there could be no contact between
Ahura-Mazda and the Spirit of Evil and of
Outer Darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his wisdom, Ahura-Mazda, the Creator,
brought man into existence, forming the earth
for his abode. He endowed man also with intelligence
to perceive, and freedom to choose
between good and evil, so far as his immediate
actions were concerned. As a natural consequence,
the earth became the arena of conflict
between the powers of Good and Evil. The
object of both was the souls of men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over those who chose purity of life, who were
pure and noble in all their dealings with others,
were just and merciful, over these, Ahriman,
the Evil Spirit, could obtain no mastery.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the man impure in thought and action,
unjust, dishonest and cruel, the great god
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'>[154]</span>Ahura-Mazda could not extend his protection,
and except through earnest and honest repentance
his soul was doomed in the life to come
to the service of the Evil One and to final destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, the man who followed
the leadings of the God of Goodness and Wisdom,
was assured that at his death his soul
passed to a state of eternal blessedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>These “sweet and reasonable doctrines”
included no taint of fanaticism. While pervaded
by the spirit of their founder, they were
never urged at the point of the sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the 30th chapter of the Yasna, in which
is preserved the celebrated speech of Zoroaster
to Vistacpe and his court, it is distinctly stated
that the great prophet relied solely upon persuasion
and argument.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the account given by Firdusi of this occasion,
Zoroaster is quoted as saying: “Learn,
O King, the rites and doctrines of the religion
of excellence; for without religion there cannot
be any worth in a king.” “When the
mighty monarch heard him speak of the excellent
religion, he accepted from him the rights
and doctrines.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The date of Zoroaster is uncertain. Various
authors assign him to different periods, from
2500 to 1000 B. C.; while others refer him to
still remoter dates.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'>[155]</span>Anquetil Duperron places him in the time
of Hystaspes, father of Darius; and Bunsen at
2500 B. C.; but scholars generally agree upon
the period between 1400 to 1000 B. C.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of Darius, 521 B. C., Zoroastrianism
was the national religion of the Persians.
In one of the inscriptions of Darius, we find
this reference:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mazda, who created this earth and that
heaven, who created man and man’s dwelling
place, who made Darius king, the one and only
king of many.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This and other references in the inscriptions
indicate the time of Zoroaster as before the
date of Darius.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ancient Persian traditions represent Zoroaster
as a native of Bactria, and that the important
address to king Vistacpi and his court
was delivered in the ancient city of Balkh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Bunsen says of Zoroaster’s conception,
that “it was not less grand than that of Abraham;
but that the distinctive difference lay in
these facts; Zoroaster attempted a conciliatory
compromise between his stern antagonism to
nature worship, and the retention of the ancient
rites and symbols of such worship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Abraham, on the other hand, excinded nature
worship altogether, and sought to banish
it as utterly as possible from his religiously
segregated society. “In this,” he urges, “the
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'>[156]</span>Hebrew man of God stands above the Aryan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From happy Bactria, this religion of “excellence”
spread among the numerous tribes
of Iranians into all Persia, finally becoming
the state religion. This was also known from
its earliest to its latest history, as the “Book
Religion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Parsee tradition, Zoroaster was
the author of the Avesta, which, when first
written, consisted of twenty-one nosks or parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also stated that this book was in a form
of writing invented by Zoroaster, and which
the Maga, or priests of this cult called the
“writing of religion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was written on twelve thousand cow-hides,
in ink of gold and the work was bound together
by golden bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various Greek writers, who followed the
wake of Alexander’s conquests in Persia, claim
to have seen the original, which was preserved
in the archives of Persepolis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Traditional accounts state that there were
two copies of this work, one of which was destroyed
in the palace of Persepolis, which was
burned by order of Alexander, and the other
was destroyed by the Greeks in some other
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also copies of the various nosks
or parts in the hands of the priesthood, which
thus escaped destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'>[157]</span>After the death of Alexander, the Zoroastrian
priests gathered the remaining fragments,
putting these into book form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Five hundred years later, at the close of the
Parthian dynasty in Persia, another collection
of the Avesta fragments, both oral and written,
was instituted, at the command and under
the patronage of King Vologases, the last of
the Arascids, about A. D. 225.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of editing and revising these collections
was continued under the early Sassanian
kings, with whom the ancient nationality
again became ascendant, and with this, the
ancient Persian religion and its literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new Avesta thus produced was proclaimed
canonical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the later Sassanian kings, the Avesta
was transcribed in the later Pehlevi or Parsee
script, in which form it has survived to the
present day. Of this, however, but a portion
remains. The Sassanian dynasty ended with
the conquest of Persia by the Mohammedan
Arabs in 641 A. D.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fury of persecution which broke over
all Iran at this time, Zoroastrianism as a national
faith was crushed, and the sacred literature
of Persia was again scattered abroad by
the devastating influences of war and fanaticism.
To the religion of Zoroaster that of
Mohammed succeeded, the Avesta was replaced
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'>[158]</span>by the Koran, and the Arabian alphabet
supplanted the Persian as a national script and
has so remained to the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient national life of Persia was not
crushed out at once, but continued a vigorous
though ineffectual resistance for centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>During these troublous times, probably about
the ninth century A. D., a colony of Persians
who held fast to their ancient faith, fled from
their country, and after many years wanderings,
finally established themselves on the
western coast of India, from Bombay to Surat.
They brought with them the remains of their
sacred literature, to which other missing portions
were added from time to time, as they
could obtain them from their brethren in the
faith who remained in Persia, chiefly at Kerman
and Yezd.</p>

<p class='c000'>They adopted the language of the Hindus
among whom they settled, but steadfastly
maintained their religion and customs.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is from the descendants of these refugees—the
Parsees of India—that the ancient sacred
books of Persia have come into our hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Avesta as it now exists, consists of four<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
parts, the Yasna, the Visparad, the Vendidad
and the Kordash, or Little Avesta. Each of
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'>[159]</span>these parts are remainders of the older collection
and are of different dates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yasna, a collection of hymns and prayers
for divine service, includes the “Gathas,”
the most ancient and sacred portion of the
Avesta. These are evidently what they claimed
to be—the work of Zoroaster. The language
in which they are composed is as old, if
not more ancient than the Sanskrit of the oldest
Vedas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The allusion to these hymns throughout the
various parts of the Avesta, shows them to
have been in existence long before all other
portions of these collections were written.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, to all to whom Zoroaster is a living
personality, the internal evidences of these utterances
point distinctly to him as their author.
Claiming no higher distinction than a teacher
and preacher among his people, there could
have been no time in the history of the religion
of which he was the founder, than during his
own life and work in which they could have
had their origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>These devout pleadings with the Divine for
his people, that he and they might be led aright,
does not savour of the higher spiritual dignities
accorded to Zoroaster in later times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following quotation from the Gathas

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
